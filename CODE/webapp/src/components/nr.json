        " I have 50% blockage beside the a fib and regurgitation left ventricle. Enlarged heart I can\u2019t seem to find a good cardiologist. Hello @swenglert, Welcome to Connect. we\u2019re so glad you\u2019ve joined us, and thank you for sharing your history. Here\u2019s what I found: \u201cCardiac cephalgia is a type of secondary headache disorder, usually initiated by exertion that is related to myocardial ischemia.\u201d https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25819974 I\u2019m tagging @bibi12 @amynewheart @fr0ggie @murryone @jms7 @cynaburst, who have experience with cardiomyopathy, and you may also be interested in these discussions on cardiomyopathy: \u2013 https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/what-is-cardiomyopathy-can-you-explain-systolic-cardiomyopathy-how-about-diastolic-cardiomyopathy/ \u2013 https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/dilated-cardiomyuopathy-meds/ \u2013 https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/cardiomyopathy/ While we wait for members to join in, I\u2019d also encourage you to read this information from Mayo Clinic about myocardial ischemia: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocardial-ischemia/basics/definition/con-20035096 @swenglert, have the doctors explained what type of cardiomyopathy you might have? In reply to @carnes \"I have 50% blockage beside the a fib and regurgitation left ventricle. Enlarged heart I can't...\" + (show) Hi, Carnes. You have enough issues, symptoms and signs to raise a high suspicion of primary systemic cardiac amyloidosis, along with the blockage. Even the blockage could be secondary to an Amy\u2026. The A-Fib can be non-valve related, but come from Amy in the sensori-motor nerves between sections of the heart, or between the heart and brain, or in the brain. The enlarged heart is typical (75%) Cardiac AL Amy, especially if the QRS tracing on a 12-lead of either ventricle or atrial wall(s) show low voltage, under .5mv, or <about half what a typical enlarged heart cardiomyopathy will show. If you can, start with a good hematologist. Ask them to run a FreeLiteChain@ and a 12-lead ecg on you, for starters. If you are not sure of the hematologist\u2019 expertise, demand that they send the results to a skilled and experienced center such as Mayo-Rochester, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, City of Hope, Brigham & Women\u2019s, Etc. Some doctors won\u2019t do this, so head out the door and take a vacation in Rochester, Philly, Boston or LA, and check with the experienced center directly. It might be the best vacation you have ever had. Save your life, or at least make it longer. In reply to @kanaazpereira \"Hello @swenglert, Welcome to Connect. we're so glad you've joined us, and thank you for sharing...\" + (show)        Hi @kanaazpereire According to CC, I have non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. That\u2019s my confusion with the cardiac headaches. i really don\u2019t have blockages for the rare symptom. The small vessel disease could be causing it which is also rare. In reply to @kanaazpereira \"Hello @swenglert, Welcome to Connect. we're so glad you've joined us, and thank you for sharing...\" + (show)        Hi @swenglert, Thank you for the update. Here\u2019s a more recent article on Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy that you may wish to view: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5089491/ I\u2019m also tagging Mentor @predictable, as he may have some more insight for you."

        "hi... everyone.. i'm new to mayo clinic's discussion. from pittsburgh. not sure where to start.....\nmy heart issues started in 2011 when i was diagnosed with a lbbb, everything was going good. my cardiologist was even going to take me off the bp medicine in 2015. late 2015, i started having the same symptoms after doing stuff around the house. dizziness, lightheaded, pressure up left side of neck which lead to nausea and dry heaves. my cardiologist decides to do a stress test..... result an ef rate below 34%. after 4 days in the hospital in jan. 2016 and a new cardiologist, i felt great with the new medicine. even though my ef rate increase to 40%, i could not shake the old symptoms. in the fall of 2016, i got to the point that i couldn't carry my granddaughter at the pumpkin patch without shortness of breathe. went back to my new cardiologist, he told me you have cardiomyopathy, but there's no blockages. it could be small vessel disease but not sure. go back to your pcp. the pcp told me it was my heart....and i needed to get a 2nd opinion. at that point, besides the all the above symptoms, the pressure in the neck was getting it my left temple and jaw causing pain and a extreme headache. my wife and i decided to go to cc for the 2nd opinion. after 3 trips, i got no direction from the cardiologists but that i have cardiomyopathy with hypertension due to exertion and a heart that has 3 valves slightly leaking. all they did at cc was raise my bp and coreg medicine. back to pittsburgh. now 8 months later still have no answers, just found out that the headaches are cardiac headaches [i think the term the neurologist said was \"cardiac cephalgia\"] had to suspend my cardiac rehab due to the pressure and headache pain in the left side. so there is my point, not sure what's causing the issues or why? with 2 possible issues that are vary rare????/"

Greeting Pain is signal of a problem in your health.pain can be differentiated in many ways.example you may experience headache while the problem is in the stomach.but pain is abnormal.on your side you are young 21yrs.most of the young people experience health problems mostly due to lack of activity and dehydration. I would advise you to exercise atleast 30minutes a day and drinking 8 glasses of clear fluids for 5days.then reply back if any change thank you."

I had a monitor, they found I had a 3 second pause and a 4 second one.Noticeably, except if it happens while driving, or call and hit your head. I have Sick so us syndrome.

Only once have i blacked out and that was the last major attack i had. </p><p></p><p>Thanks again</p> So still waiting for the 24hr monitir but, following the stress treadmill test, the cardiologist diagnosed angina. I will start beta blockers once holter test shows no sudden drop in heart rate. Used GTN spray for 1st time yesterday and chest pain went eithin minutes although very light headed for 30 mins or so. Still get palpitations but hopefully the beta blockers will help. Will be able to drive again in November if beta blockers have no adverse effect. I Harv it happen to me 2 days ago- turning to park the lot of Walmart and everything went black- all I can recall is hearing someone yelling not to move and then getting out as if I was in a nightmare / didn\u2019t know what the heck happened- Again today while taking my daughter to school as I was turning 1/2 of everything went black, Blessed we were because I missed the berm in the middle of the road- Don\u2019t know what it could be- just had blood work all was good- I had at the time no headache or remember my chest pounding however I do see a Neurologist as well as a cardiologist - haven\u2019t taken heart meds for 2 mo that after I lost it and waiting on the pharmacy to contact the Doc- I do recall having pain the day prior in my neck where I had a C5/C6 fusion- and feeling dizzy upon standing- pain and burning down my r arm- I\u2019m petrafide to drive-"

        " Hi Barberry. I suppose I'm not being of any help to you replying to your desperate letter as I have not got a clue, but I do sympathise with you as I suffered bad head pain on the top, left and back of my head daily for a few years now which pushes my BP up I suffer with everyday headaches from when I get up in the morning to bedtime. I do sleep because I now take 10mgs of Melatonin by morning my head is hurting again. I can tell my doctor has not a clue and is treating the symptoms and not the cause. He offered me Amitriptyline 10mgs one to five at night. These drugs have been on the market since 1961 and were used as a antidepressant, now used for pain/headaches , they did ease my headaches After 6 months I stopped taking them as I felt brain dead and unresponsive by morning and it took me a long time to wake up. Now trying Diazepam 5mg twice daily. They are addictive and I don't want to take them. I take BP meds and think perhaps they are the cause of my bad heads! I don't have a TV so spend a lot of time on my computer so now I'm trying anti blue light glasses, deep breathing and tapping. Perhaps alternative medicine may help? I do get out walking twice daily in the fresh air, I'm lucky enough to live by the coast. Hope it helps ! I wish you well, take care and stay safe  I had headaches for more than one year. I took many kinds of stress headaches and migraines, too. My headaches was no relief. It took me a years to go many doctors. Now, I was diagnosed with anxiety disorders. I have been taking Duloxetine for almost year and the headaches are gone. It took about 8 months to feel the headaches relief."

        "hello everybody, if this is against the rules, please let me know. i am here seeking advice about my headaches. i am here out of desperation. i'm not necessarily seeking a diagnosis for my issue but rather advice on where to go next, what questions to ask my physicians, etc. i am a 25-year-old male. i weigh 185 pounds. i have diagnoses of ibs with constipation, generalized anxiety disorder, and i am currently being evaluated by a sleep specialist for possible sleep apnea. i have dealt with headaches my entire life. my first mri for headaches was after an accident in gymnastics where i hit my head in 2005. i had a ct in the er, where they noticed a shadow, so the radiologist recommended an mri. during this mri, they noticed what they believed was a neuroepithelial cyst. this cyst is still present today and is slightly larger than it was previously. fast forward to high school, i had another mri due to recurrent headaches. during this time, bilateral maxillary sinus retention cysts were noted. i was treated for allergies with nasal steroids and these headaches went away. fast forward to june, 2019. i started a new job where i had to park quite a way from my workspace. after arriving at work each day, i noticed i had a headache that would go away with a few minutes of inactivity and by cooling down. eventually, however, these headaches became harder to abort. i ended up in the er four times before i was hospitalized the first time, for what the neurologist called an intractable migraine. during my er visits, i was given multiple doses of toradol which provided no relief. i was also given fioricet and given a lumbar puncture, which showed an elevated opening pressure of 29. i was started on diamox by my er physician for suspected iih. during my first hospitalization, my neurologists claimed my er physician performed the lp incorrectly, as it is not likely for a male of normal weight to have elevated pressure or to have iih. the lp was never repeated during this stay. i was diagnosed with an intractable migraine due to my symptoms: a headache that caused the worse pain of my entire life, balance issues making it hard to walk, slurred speech, and double vision. i had no light or sound sensitivity. i was treated with the valproic acid/dhe protocol, and i was discharged in the same condition that i was admitted in. during this stay, i had a cta/ctv of the head/neck, an mri with/without contrast of the head/neck/face. everything was normal except for the cyst, which everybody agreed was benign. i requested a second opinion and saw a neurologist at home. this neurologist agreed with the er doctor and gave me a suspected diagnosis of iih and increased my diamox to 1,500mg/day. a repeat lp was ordered. about 2 months later, i had the repeat lp and had a normal opening pressure of 16. the neurologist said the diamox was working and that was good. due to my headaches worsening, the neurologist also started me on depakote. i noticed no improvement with my symptoms. i sought a 3rd opinion at the biggest hospital in my state with their headache specialist. he basically said the er doctor and my last neurologist were wrong and diagnosed me with a migraine disorder. he continued the depakote and prescribed aimovig. two weeks later, i was hospitalized with a near inability to walk due to my headaches and dizziness. they continued the dhe/valproic acid protocol which provided no relief. i was also given an occipital nerve block just in case. after a few days, i had a new attending neurologist. he didn't believe i had any symptoms of a migraine and started me on indomethacin, titrating me up to 250mg/day. this medication relieved my symptoms almost immediately, and i was diagnosed with with an indomethacin-responsive headache syndrome, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania. i was also diagnosed with primary exercise headaches. however, i still experience headaches on a daily basis. if i take less than 200mg/day of indomethacin, i have debilitating headaches that nearly justify hospitalization. my headaches are worsened by any amount of exertion. even doing dishes and sweeping my floors will trigger an immense headache. is there something my neurologists could be missing? is there another medication i should ask about? what can treat the exertion aspect of the headaches? i will include a list of medications i am currently on, as well as a list of things i have tried for the headaches and their effectiveness. currently taking: prazosin - 4mg/day for headaches venlafaxine - 75mg/day for headaches/anxiety doxepin - 10mg/day for sleep issues indomethacin - 200mg/day for headaches acetaminophen - 2,000 to 4,000mg/day for headaches miralax for constipation medications i have tried for headaches depakote - no relief aimovig - six months so far and no relief sumatriptan - oral and injections - no relief and negative cardiac symptoms nasal and im dihydroergotamine - no relief and based on recommendation of cardiologist in er, i should not take again due to negative cardiac symptoms topiramate - no relief propranolol - no relief and negative side effects amitriptyline - no relief and negative side effects duloxetine - no relief"

        " Hey, why won't your parents take you to the doctors? have you told them about everything your feeling? Do you have another adult who could take you instead just for your peace of mind. It sounds like anxiety and only being 17 years old wouldn't be a heart attack or anything like that. hopefully you can find an adult to take you to the doctors or being 17 could you just go by yourself? Sorry I'm not much help. hoping everything settles down for your soon! Cassandra  HI! i'm 17 too and i just want you to know that youre not alone. i am glad as well that im not alone experiencing this things. usually when i visit this site it's a lot of older people... anyways, i know how you feel whenever a headache is happening i feel like im gonna have an aneurysm and die. unfortunately i have death anxiety so im scared of both things. i also have chest pains and sometimes i have stomach pain but ive read somewhere thats its just the anxiety and i just keep reminding myself that. My faith in God has helped me a lot and i havent gone to the doctor about my mental health its usually just me searhcing through the internet. i wish we could talk do you have any social media? lol Sounds like anxiety, as those are all symptoms. At 17 it is unheard of to have angina, and cardiac problems are only possible if you have a genetic defect, which an echocardiogram can detect. I would go to the doctors to be sure if possible."

        " I think the reassuring thing is that so far cardiac wise it's all clear and you have had a diagnosis that would explain the burning sensations. I think alongside your ulcer you may have a bad case of Esophagitis. What ever antacids/proton pumps they gave you should help with it. My dad has a history of a lot of ulcers and he had the same symptoms as your describing. Do you have a family history of heart problems, are you healthy? (eat well and exercise, not overweight) it's really great you had the 48 hour tests that's a very useful test it's unlikely you have any long lasting arythmia if that was clear. Maybe ask for an echo to look at the structure of the heart or a stress echo. Just want to say If you ever feel like your heart is racing, sit down and relax for a bit and sip water and deep breaths. It can help even if it's not anxiety triggered. If a fast heart rate bothers you ask your GP about beta blockers, there also used of label for anxiety and migraines. They can disuse if they think it's suitable for you. I really don't think it's cardiac but I'm not a doctor, so don't stop with my advice. Keep going to your GP and if it gets severe please go to the hospital. Take care of yourself and don't be afraid to ask questions.  Some of the burning could be GERD. I am 54 and have had similar issues and mine is GERD. I know how frustrating this process is since I continue to have cardiac workups each time I have symptoms. Its always a relief that its not cardiac, However, I have been told by my cardiologist that I will need to be checked every time since I can never tell fir sure if it us my GERD, Costochondritis, or other connective tissue problems.

Cutting out themiddle man would be safest I think. I had a brain bleed, obviously they're serious, take no chances. Good luck. A person can cause a bulging disc by rolling over weirdly in bed! I would get a ct scan. Does it help to put one of your arms, lower arm resting on top of your head, up in that position? Everyone I know that has had surgery on a neck disc instinctively got in that position to alleviate the pain (for a few minutes!), including me. Doubt it is a bleed because it would be such a severe headache you wouldn't have been able to post your concern. Still, I would try to see if you might have a impinged nerve causing your headaches."

        " <p>Well, not exactly considered an advice, but I personally suffer health anxiety - cardiophobia. Experienced sudden fast and strong heart beat, it could have been AFib, but my heart tests were all fine and still i suffer from and recently i experience skipped or extra beat (same) frequently though my heart is fine. I am sure that it is caused by anxiety. Tomorrow i will buy &quot;magnesium&quot; supplement which i heard from people that it fixed their &quot;skipped beats&quot;.</p> my heart has been skipping for decades. I take Inderal LA 180 mg, a beta blocker. <p>I am 21 and got diagnosed with bradycardia too. According to </p><p>my holter monitor, my resting heartbeat is around 34. Anyways, I have heart arrhythmia too and that does not help anything at all. My doctor said that the arrhythmia was fine and it wouldn&#39;t hurt </p><p>anything. 2 weeks later I am in the back of an ambulance with </p><p>cardiac arrest. Cardiologists think that it might be because of the skipped beats and slow heart rate combined... </p> <p>Thanks for the reply - Permanent headaches from all the meds now....they say the headaches will subside....haven&#39;t...seeing Cardiologist again today...probably for&#160;more tabs....keeping the drugs industry in&#160;business but at least I&#39;m still here...Best Wishes, keep well.</p>"

Less common side effects include bruxism, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure changes, dilated pupils, anxiety, mood swings, headache, and dizziness. Rare side effects include convulsions, hallucinations, severe allergic reactions and photosensitivity. If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime rather than in the morning. Some data suggest citalopram may cause nightmares.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawal symptoms can occur when this medicine is suddenly stopped, such as paraesthesiae, sleeping problems (difficulty sleeping and intense dreams), feeling dizzy, agitated or anxious, nausea, vomiting, tremors, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhea, palpitations, changes in emotions, irritability, and eye or eyesight problems.

        "hi there, new to this forum and looking for a bit of advice or anyone with similar experience. my mum is 59 years old and last friday she had a lumpectomy for breast cancer in her left side. the surgery went well and are awaiting results in the post op next week. today, she had an upset stomach all morning. when she came back downstairs on the last occasion, she looked grey and said her head was so painful, it was throbbing. my mum has a very high pain thresholds and never complains. it got so bad that we called an ambulance as she also started getting palpitations (she also has high blood pressure for which she is taking medication daily). because the pain started from the back of her head and went up to the top, radiating all over, they suspected a bleed on the brain. at the hospital they did a ct scan, chest x-ray, 2 blood tests and gave her a saline drip. all scan results came back clear and no bleeds. the blood came back with deranged liver.... something, can't remember, but was told just to repeat blood test next week at doctors, and her ecg showed a few irregular heartbeat but they weren't concerned, just told her to go to doctors to get a 24 hour monitor. so, the severe headache subsided after she had saline drip and 8 hours in hospital, we assumed it was due to dehydration. we had a light dinner, was about to put her to bed and the headache came back again, 3 hours after getting back from hospital. we called an ambulance again because she couldn't stand for us to take her, however waiting times were long so i laid her down and put a damp towel on her head and massaged her scalp which seemed to soothe it. after an hour and a half, the pain turned to a muzzy feeling and she is managing to doze to sleep so we decided to cancel the ambulance. we were wondering whether the severe headache could be caused by panic attacks as she is obviously under a lot of stress with worrying about test results after surgery and has had panic attacks before with palpitations, but nothing like this. seeing as all of her tests and scans came back clear, albeit some minor problems with liver and heart, it's the only other conclusion we can get to. as soon as i could soothe her head and try to calm her, it was subsiding. anyone have any thoughts? it would be much appreciated for any guidance received."

        " i would ask about prinzmetal angina or syndrome x angina, also there are a number of muscle lining and chest infections that can casue similar sypmtoms. Your GP amy not be too aware of Prinzmeatl but worth a try also if in heart or heart area chest pain and it does last then you wont be wasting anyones time unless you dont get help...worth disucssing all the options with GP and cardilogist (I have Prinzmetal and syndrome x (along with intermitent Arrhythmia and ME...) I would stress stronlgy if in pain and it doenst clear with GTN then call for assistance but if either of the above anginas thne it may be a challange getting diagnosis and help if an infection then antibiotics will see you right ... get an Xray eyc to be sure, again ask them questions ... Good luck!!!! hope it goes well and you do indeed get better soon!!!!! Hi nick, Is there a pattern to your chest pain, like does it come on between 8pm -8am ? Not a lot of people know this but GTN is also prescribed for indigestion, I'm not suggesting that's what it is but just thought I'd throw that into the works, Your GP would of given you a simpler form of medication for that, one that doesn't leave a person with a thumping headache from the GTN :) I see you said, no signifiicant narrowing, this could be the start of angina for you as that's what was said to me years ago \"no significant narrowing\" but 2 years later I had another Angiogram and a 50-60 % occlussion was found in my right coronary artery. You also mentioned about having a drink or 2 in the evening, perhaps this is your bodies way of relaxing after a couple of drinks ?"

        "hello all, wonder if someone can help me. i have been to the hospital on 3 occasions in the last 2 years because i have felt unwell and have suffered [b]minor chest pain[/b] each time the hospital has been very careful and carried blood tests etc which have all been clear of a heart attack. i have also had an angiogram which showed no significant narrowing of arteries. i have recently been getting some mild chest pain again more like little twinges along with longer periods of a heavy or tight feeling. the doctor has given me a tnt spray which so far i have only used twice both times it has seemed to improve the tightness but not completly, the doctor said that if it didnt go after 10mins to call 999, but surely it cant be a heart attack as its been going on for days ? i normally have a drink or two in the evening and without fail the tightness goes, is this because the blood is thinning ? i really dont want to waste the hospitals time if it is just stress of just a chest infection, any advice ? nick"
