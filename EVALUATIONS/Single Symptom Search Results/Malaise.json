I was an attender of a Mental Health Day Centre for ten years and eventually I was put into their Information Centre, I had a small Terrier, He would sit on my knee all day and people outside saw the dog and it broke the ice with those needing help. The whole centre was really good, the members would be help in their own right. we would stick up for eachother and help when ill. That eventually helped my Anxiety and Reactive Depression. I moved a long way from my friends there and now never see them, shame really. That was my help, still have problems and will take medications for the rest of my life. However I remember happy days with nice people/friends BOB <p>When i was admitted to hospital back in Summer 2015 for a physical health problem my anxiety became very unsettled like it so often did ( still does ) when i hospital , local mental health centre , one of the Nurses told me while my breathing was all over the place - breath in an count to 5 , breath out an count to 5 , an so on , does help to settled ones breathing / eases it an you have control of doing that yourself , eventually your body will settle , like wise a panic attack which isn&#39;t too serious .</p><p>?A copying method of dealing with unsettling situations - overnight stays in hospital , sitting in waiting rooms for appointments , etc - Colouring for Grown-ups has eased my mental health many a time .</p> When I have panic attacks I imagine myself on a calm, stranded beach and I try and link my breathing with the waves.

        " hi can you please help me as im suffering so badly with anxiety as my relationship has broken down after 4 years and im so devastated , we had an argument last week and now my boyfriend is refusing to discuss anything with me and everytime I ring him he gets really angry and shouts terrible abuse at me , I am trying to not contact him as I want to leave him alone to try and sort his drinking and his anger issues out but I keep feeling so anxious and sad that I keep wanting to put things right between us and feel so low, my doctor has prescribed proprananol 80 ml a day , please can you tell me will this take these awful feelings away and help me try and relax and feel better , thankyou kaz5 Hi Kaz, sorry to hear you are going through this. Propranolol helps with panic symptoms rather than depression, it will help you feel a little more relaxed but unfortunately doesn't stop the anguish or feelings of worry. For me it just helps keep me composed for work and social situations, I still feel depressed but at least the anxiety is kept at bay and I can still lead a normal life. I am now struggling with feeling lonely and having trouble sleeping so Im going to get some advice on that, I feel a little better each day - you will get there, try keeping yourself busy and spend time with friends or family if you can. hi and thank you so much , the doctor has also prescribed me with diazipan which I am taking at night time to try and relax me and help me to sleep , ive always had depression on and off but this last few years I feel as if I am lost in a world of grief , I was married for many years and in the end I felt lonely and I think I got bored so I decided to call it a day only to regret my decision in every way , my ex husband then got with my friend at work and they have since married in a big lavish wedding and are so happy and in love that I feel I wish it was me, almost 4 years ago I met a man off the internet and we have dated ever since but hes such a different type to what im used to and doesn't show me any real affection and when I asked him if he loved me he said he cares for me , the thing is this man is a very heavy drinker and ive been trying to tell him hes drinking to much as its about 5 large bottles of vodka a week , anyway I think with my nagging hes been getting fed up with me hes still been drinking but it was lager for a while ,anyway this man has got the worse anger issues ive ever know he has a very stressfull job and gets wound up for no real reason , we went away the weekend before last and had an ok time but a few rows over the drink again, anyway when we got home all was ok then a row broke out over my dog begging for his food and I went home but before I left his house I told him he was making me feel miserable ect , now hes said ive done what I did and I went home so as far as hes concearened I finished it and that's that, ive been trying to put things right but all he keeps doing if I try and contact him is saying look I refuse to disguss whats happened and you need to just get on with your life , I asked him was it over for good then and he said its looking that way , ive spoken to him about other things and he will answer them but nothing to do with us , as ive moved house after my divorce my dog doesn't like it there as hes old and stuck in his ways anyway he howls in the day so my fella has been letting him stay at his house as he lives in a detached house and the howling doesn't get heard so bad there the dogs been there for over a year now, anyway my fella says the dog can still stay there in the day as long as were gone before he gets home which we have been , the only thing is its upsetting for me to still go to his house everyday as it keep bringing back all the memories and upset of the break up , ive offered my chap he keys back and ive got quite a large amount of money of his in my bank account ive also offered that back too but he just keeps saying leave it for now , I wish someone could help me feel better as I feel so devastated that its over for ever , I keep sayig sorry and he just keeps saying but you wont change , my sister inlaw says hes keeping me on a bit of string and hes punishing me for walking out , but I don't know as im so ill and I get so down and confused about things, I know hes not a great person to be around at times , but im so alone and I feel I need him , can anyone help me to try and feel better as im stuck in this house alone and I sometimes feel now that without any company of my own I cant go on , thanks for reading . Hi, I have started taking propranolol to combat anxiety issues and wondered how long the side effects take to subside, ie feeling slightly spaced and tired. Thanks After a week I felt fine but the sleeping pills gave me side effects which I still have to manage with today."

        "Hi, I am a 36 year old professional male and for the past 3 months I've been suffering with anxiety attacks. I thought the anxiety feelings of panic was actually brought on by low blood sugar but my blood tests came back fine and at that point I realised my issues were linked to anxiety. I am usually a confident person and only ever experienced anxiety when presenting to large groups at work, basically I could feel my heart racing and had an urgent need to leave the room (flight response), I could hold my ground and get through it but it was the worst feeling in the world. Other than presentations I would usually be 100% confident, I go on dates or even interviews with no anxiety but recently I can get the same anxious feelings by just meeting a friend for dinner or taking a phone call. I have had some issues in my personal life which I think have brought these on and also my work has been very quiet lately so I have been pretty isolated - a \"big deal\" used to be a work presentation and now its just a meeting or even seeing a friend. My anxiety could range from feeling uncomfortable and uneasy through to a medium panic attack. During a panic attack I can sit there and function but I feel dreadful and its so difficult to articulate myself, I just feel like running out the room. I could spend the weekend with family and my girlfriend and be fine, then head for dinner the same day, with the same people and feel anxious in the restaurant. My GP prescribed Propranolol, 40mg to take before anxious situations or twice a day, whichever I felt comfortable with. I had been feeling dreadful that week, had a couple of anxiety attacks and had been extreemly restless and unhappy, my sleep was heavily disturbed too and I couldn't eat. I had lost a stone over the past few months, mainly from loss of appetite and from not drinking (due to this making everything worse the following day). I took a 40mg tab that evening, 2 hours before going out. Within an hour I felt so relaxed, I literally felt like my worries and anxiety was releasing from my body. That evening I had planned to go to the cinema, the building was packed and there was stress getting a ticket. I had felt anxious about this earlier that day (before taking my first Propranolol) but when I arrived I felt in control. I was chatty to the people behind, we got our tickets and I really enjoyed the film - previously I have felt trapped by being in the cinema around lots of people. I didn't sleep very well that night but the following day I felt fine, I took a tablet with breakfast and headed to work. Certain situations which would cause my anxiety to rise just didn't phase me all day long, I was proactive to try to provoke situations that could cause me to be anxious and nothing happened. I ended up heading to the shops after work and then to visit family at 7pm, by the evening I could feel that the Propranolol was wearing off and I did feel slightly anxious and it was more difficult to talk to family members. I still need to test the Propranolol during more stressful situations but so far I have been amazed with how effective this drug is. I still feel a little down but my worrying thoughts do not spiral out of control as they used to. When confronted with a tense situation by body just holds its ground like it used to and I seem to be able to get through anything now. I get a little tingling feeling, as if my body is trying to make me feel anxious, but it just gets no momentum and this then gives me confidence to continue. Propranolol is such an amazing drug. Side effects wise I have had disturbed sleep and a slight aching round by my kidneys. No sweating, sexual disfunction, irritability etc - everything feels fine. I actually didn't take a tablet last night and slept really well but I did feel anxious for an hour this morning until the tablet kicked in. I think I am going to take it twice daily to have some regularity and make sure I take this early enough for it to kick in before my first meeting each day. I realise that Propranolol isn't fixing the root issue and I plan to have counciling in the next few weeks (GP is sorting that out). I do think that Propranolol has enabled me to get my life back on track, I can go to work, see friends and lead a normal life whereas just a week ago I was thinking I'd have to give up work and possibly move back in with my parents for them to look after me, that seems crazy now looking back. I would strongly recommend Propranolol to anyone suffering with anxiety, panic attacks or possibly even to help get through tough presentations or interviews. That's me story, I will come back and add updates - anyone else had similar experiences?"

        "Hello fellow Bisoprolol buddies - I cannot actually believe that I didn't think of doing a search on Bisoprolol earlier as it is so comforting to have discovered this web page. I have been taking Bisoprolol Fumarate 5mg daily for the past 3 years following a frightening episode in town which resulted in my spending a week in the Cardiac ward of our local hospital. I had SVT while in hospital and the 'specialists' couldn't actually put a cause to my soaring blood pressure and rapid heartbeat. So, I've been told to stay on these tablets for life... I'm 48 now, was 45 then. The comforting thing about reading the majority of these posts is that so many people are feeling ridiculous levels of tiredness; I don't recognise myself from 3 years ago. This isn't whingeing, just stating a fact. I have piled on the pounds - particularly blubby around my midriff - yet I eat less than ever. I am sometimes so overcome by exhaustion that I have to stop even the most trivial of chores. I have lost my 'get up and go', yet used to be so active with my three kids. I used to be so house proud, yet now can'tbe bothered other than to 'keep on top' of the housework. I used to love socialising, again, can't be bothered most of the time and when I do, I am glad when it is over. I love the peace and quiet of my own company so much more now and feel exhausted by company. Yet I AM ONLY 48 YEARS OLD!!! I realise I am lucky to be alive, to be uncursed by serious ills, but still, it is healthy to have a little moan now and then, and gratifying to feel online empathy with other 'sufferers'. I find that my partner and children don't really understand - can't blame them, I don't truly either. Take care one and all."

        " thank`s for shearing your helpful tips..you were discuses about vitamin it was a good experience for me. then i would suggest you Doctorshealthpress also helpful for health tips...  Thanks for your helpful tips, I have been suffering from FS following surgery for a stiff shoulder. I had a 'clear out' and was doing really well for the first 3 weeks until I accidently jarred my elbow, the pain was excrutiating. That was at the end of April and I've been in agony ever since. My physio and the surgeon have both diagnosed FS - I'm having physio once a week and it does help for a little while. I would love a decent night's sleep! I haven't had any uninterupted sleep for over 4 months and I'm knackered! I'm taking pain killers and anti-inflamatory but they don't seem to work for very long. I really hope this goes away soon as I could fall out with myself, it's very sore and making me very grumpy. I read the bit about staying positive and I try to do this but there are times when the pain just gets me down and reduces me to tears. I do hope this eases off soon, I'm at my whits end. Thank you for your comments Painful of Uckfield. I am now overjoyed to say that I am now completely pain free and enjoying life again. I still have some stiffness and am slightly limited in my movement, but slowly, slowly I did get better. So don't give up hope. Stay positve and look for the smallest signs of improvement. You will get better. I wish you well. Thank very much. I wish you continued good health :) Thank you so much Frosty. You offer a no-nonsense approach to this very debilitating disease. I was feeling quite sorry for myself, but your message gave me the jolt I needed to get it all into focus. Surprising how much better I feel just applying some of your suggestions. Again, my thanks. Chickabee  This is such great advise! Thank you for taking the time to write it all out! Hi Frosty i missed all these tips when I logged in first time. They're great! thank you for sharing. I'm now at the 1 year stage on my left shoulder and the 2 month stage on my right shoulder, so both thawing and freezing! I've tried pretty much everything but now just learning to live with it alongside good pain medication, in my case  Oops Fentanyl patches, they take the edge off. are there any IRL support groups in East Sussex that you know of? I subscribe to everything that Frosty layed out here. Follow her/his advice and do seek the proper help, especially if this is your first one. I've just been diagnosed with this and I've found this to be most helpful. Thank you Frosty! Hi Frosty I have to make a decision as to surgery or not for a grade three ac joint injury, can you please help? Cheers jonesfia Thank you Frosty for your advice. I had Fs for 3 to 4 months but only being diagnosed last week. When the sharp pain first occurred, an ultra sound showed everything was normal. My usual GP on leave, I went to another clinic whom sent me away with pain killers that have no relief to the pain. I then went and see a physiotherapist who put this electronic thing on my shoulder (I believe is called Ten) followed with 3 min exercise of pulling. Each visit lasted for 25 min or less with no relief to the pain. I then moved on to massage who specified that they treat FS, it does reduced some of the pain during the day but night time after sleeping sitting up, the pain will woke me up after I some how finding myself lying flat! The lack of good sleep is tormenting, I agree with my GP to go for cortisone injection, had that 9 hours ago. The Procedure feels horrible because I can feel the fluid near the end of the injection and it feel like a vein in my shoulder is going to explode! However, many people said they only feel normal vaccination pain. About 5 hours ago my face and arms started feeling tingling, the sensation seems to subside a bit now. Hopefully it will do some good. Should update later, hopefully after a bit of good night sleep \ud83d\ude0a thats all good advice , but its easier said than done , in an ideal world yes , but this isnt an ideal world Just been diagnosed today. I've only had it for about 6 weeks so just have pain, when puting on a coat and bra (not in that order!) for example. Stil got good movement and I had been doing stretches for a couple of weeks pre-diagnosis. Does it always progress to frozen? The thought of not being able to move my arm properly terrifies me."

        "Be patient. This is a LONG disease. Remember, adhesive capsulitis is a disease, not a syndrome or a condition; it has a beginning, middle and END. Wherever you are in the cycle, you're moving toward the END. \u2013 Educate yourself! There's lots of information on the internet about adhesive capsulitis, and many different ideas and approaches. Read everything you can. -- Be aware that the medical community does not agree about the best way to treat FS. One doctor may say, \\&quot;Do nothing, it will get better on its own.\\&quot; Another doctor might say, \\&quot;Let\u2019s operate!\\&quot; One doctor might say, \\&quot;Start physical therapy right away.\\&quot; Another might say, \\&quot;PT won't help till you're in the thawing stage.\\&quot; You must educate yourself to know what is truly the best approach for YOU. If you don't like your doctor or your physical therapist, change! Find caregivers who know this disease. Not all of them do! Don't let ANYONE rush you into anything. You have time to decide what's best for you. \u2013 Get painkillers. If one kind doesn't work, try another. Don\u2019t give up. There\u2019s no reason to be in a lot of pain. There are lots of different kinds of painkillers, so work with your doctor until you find one that works for you. Be assertive about your treatment choices. There are studies showing that FS eventually gets better no matter what you do or don't do, so make the choices yours. \u2013 Slow down mentally and emotionally. Develop patience and serenity. Be kind to yourself. -- Slow down physically. Without the use of your arm, you don't have your usual physical balance, and you could get hurt if you try to maintain your usual pace. \u2013 Take lots of naps. Your whole body is ill, not just your shoulder. Eat healthy food. Drink LOTS of water. Take vitamins. Use cold packs and hot packs. They help. Frozen peas are great for icing -- you can thaw and refreeze them over and over. (Just don't get confused and eat them!) Be sure you do your exercises, icing, and heat with the good shoulder as well as the bad -- it's getting an extra workout, and deserves to be pampered. -- But don't work your good shoulder TOO hard. Studies show that people who get FS in one shoulder are more likely to get it in the other shoulder later on. Take baths -- long ones, as hot as you can stand. Immerse your shoulder. Play soothing music and light a scented candle. Use an inflatable bath pillow. Sleep with lots of little pillows. Tuck them all around you. Experiment with the pillows till you find a comfortable arrangement. -- Have a favourite pillow. Tuck it under your arm when you sleep. Take it with you to the movies, or on car rides; use it to prop up your arm whenever you'll be sitting for a long time. -- Put a big pillow between yourself and your bedfellow so they don't roll over and bump into you. -- It's okay to sleep in the recliner for awhile. -- Pamper yourself. Ask your loved ones to pamper you. -- Don't hesitate to remind your friends and colleagues that you have a problem. To them, you look normal and healthy. -- Learn to ignore housecleaning, errands, dishes, cooking -- these things are not important. And if someone dares to complain... \u2013 Ask for help. It seems like strong, active people are prone to this disease -- and strong, active people are not so good at asking for help. Learn to ask. -- Show your spouse and children how to help you with your coat, how to open doors for you, how to carry groceries, how to cook and clean... What a great opportunity to teach them new skills! \u2013 Rearrange workspaces so that things are easier to reach. BBQ tongs are great for reaching. Use a stool. But be careful! With only one arm, your balance is impaired. -- Get yourself a good one-handed haircut, something that doesn't require blow-drying or extra fuss. -- Consider buying a free-standing hairdryer stand, \u201cas seen on TV\u201d. -- When dressing, always put the bad arm in its sleeve before the good arm. -- Forget the jeans, wear pull-ups or sweatpants. -- Find a bra that clips in the front. Or try this: put your bra on around your waist, back to front. Clip it with the clip in front of you, and then rotate the clip around to the back. Then slide the bra up, slip the arm straps up over your shoulders, and voila! Better yet, you may find a sports bra is easier to put on. And if this still doesn\u2019t work, or is too painful\u2026 -- No one will notice if you go without a bra. Camisoles are also great! -- For a bathing suit, a tankini is an excellent choice. Having a hard time washing under your arms? Try holding a washcloth in plastic salad tongs. Tongs are also good for applying deodorant. Deodorant not working well? Try baby powder. -- After bathing, if you have trouble drying under your arm, use a blowdryer set on \\&quot;cool\\&quot;. -- Ladies, to shave under your arm, try the \\&quot;Finishing Touch\\&quot; razor. It's battery operated and about the size of a ballpoint pen. It really gets into tight places! -- Use a wallet instead of a purse. Fanny packs are also great. -- Slip-on shoes make things easier. You can also try a long shoehorn. -- Get your medication in a flip-off lid. Watch your posture during everyday activities. Slouching makes things worse. -- Stay active in other ways. Walking (if you can) is especially good. -- Try massage therapy. Lots of FS sufferers swear by it. Remember that there will be good days and bad days, but eventually, slowly, it WILL get better. Adhesive Capsulitis is NOT PERMANENT. -- Keep a journal to record your progress. -- Log onto this site and tell others how you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s a long road to healing, but it'll seem shorter if if you don\u2019t travel it alone. -- Everyone's FS journey is different. If you share your experience, it might help someone else. So share. -- Every time you make the smallest progress, give yourself a pat on the back. (Figuratively, not literally -- none of us here can contort that way!) -- Be positive. You will get well.

        " hiya margaret, first off, your not a junkie, just a victim of circumstances thats all, what a great post you put together, very wise words indeed, stop beating yourself up over your unfortunate situation, its not your fault and never will be. some people have a genetic make up that makes them more prone to addiction than others, given your attitude and determination im certain you will beat your dependency on zopiclone, its not a matter of if but when margaret and as regards folks attitude, take no notice of what they think, ignore them, its them that have a problem, not you ^_ cheers, Ken ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Oh I'm so glad I stumbled upon this. Thank you so much Margaret! I am struggling horribly with this drug. My psych said it's non-addictive & I can just stop taking it. The addiction to it snuck up on me so insidiously too. I first only took a 7,5mg tab maybe 2-3 times a week, at night. Before I knew it, I was waking up in what I now know was withdrawal. Terrible anxiety, nauseous, tummy pain, sweats and so very fearful. I began taking a 1/2 7.5mg tab around mid morning when I couldn't bear the anxiety any longer, as I recalled how it relaxed me when I had taken just one 7.5mg at night, occasionally, as when i was first prescribed it, I didn't want to become addicted to it. Even though my psych said it's not addictive, I didn't want to take the chance, as I have an addictive personality. I didn't realize I'd be needing to start having it every morning since taking that first time morning dose. The calming effect only lasted for about 2 hrs, and I'd have to have another 1/2 tab. Within 3 days I was taking up to 6 halves of the 7.5mg tabs, and STILL wanting, craving more, but managed to not give in, as I saw how it could easily escalate out of control. I got very frightened indeed. I am now stuck with living my days full of anxiety, and all that goes that, making life HELL! I was once a happy, calm & well-adjusted person until this. I was prescribed it only because I'd gone through a period of not sleeping well. My psych (who, by the way, I was referred to by my GP to wean me off another highly addictive med - valium, which I no longer needed), & instead of doing that, she put me on this zopiclone. I wish now, that I'd researched it before ever taking it but I trusted her, believed her when she said it's non-addictive, and took it just to get a few good nights sleep. I am now finally weaning off valium, but stuck with this horrific zopiclone addiction. Try as I might, not to take it during the day, I have to end up giving in, as I'm an emotional, nervous & jittery wreck! My God, how did this happen to me? I'm down to 1/2 a 7.5mg tab, 3 times daily, but living with a terrible burden of anxiousness, nausea, and just emotionally unstable, feeling like I just can't cope, and I hate to admit it, but clock-watching until it's time for my next dose. I maybe get around 2 hrs of a little peace, then BOOM! The nightmare begins again. I have to hang out & not give into the temptation of having a dose of it, as I really, really want to get off it, and just know if I give in, I'll just be needing more & more of it and it will never end. So, that's where I'm at, at this time. Trying my hardest to wean off this incredibly nasty drug, as well as valium. I'm not having a problem with having less valium, but zopiclone has me nearly beaten. BUT, I AM DETERMINED to get off it, as it's mind & soul-destroying! I'm angry at my psych for being so ill-informed about it, and for being so blase about it, thinking & saying I can \"Just stop taking it as it's non-addictive\". I'm going to print out all the info I can find, and show her just how dangerous this drug is! I want my life back. I want the easy-going, happy me back! Thanks Margaret & Ken. Great explanations & advice! I'm now completely off these, after tapering for a few days, then had enough of that, as it was too hard. Stopped cold turkey, went through 6 sleepless nights,(and lots of agony) but was determined, as I knew to expect that. Got through & I AM FREE OF THIS POISON! Threw out the rest in the rubbish, to make sure I wouldn't be tempted ever again. Gone cold turkey on valium now, as my prescribing psych did not send me my script 2 weeks ago. My GP gave me the option of seeing another psych, but I said NO, as I want to free of that benzo poison as well. Going through some intense moments of absolute terror, & all that comes with withdrawal, but once again, my determination & faith in God is strengthening me. As for that last comment there, by the person who didn't even give their name, I'm speechless! What kind of brain-dead advice is that? Just goes to show what weed does to your brain! Poor misguided soul!"

        "Hi my name is Margaret and I am a 35 year old housewife who is prescribed 3x 3.75mg zopiclone a nightand I would like to share with you the signs of an addiction silently creeping up in order someone might recognise where they are and stop the process( unlike I who was given no warning s at all and blundered in foolishly.) My doctor failed to tel me on first prescribing zopiclone 1. THEY ARE HABIT FORMING PHYSIOLOGICALLY IF TAKEN DAILY FOR JUST A WEEK!!!4 Point 2 , THERE ARE STUDIES SHOWING REPEATED INFECTIONS OF THE BODY WHEN TAKEN LONG TERM DUE TO THE FACT THEY ARE THOUGHT TO DAMAGE IMMUNE RESPONSES. THIS DRUG IS EVEN THOUGHT TO CAUSE CANCERS DUE TO DECREASED IMMUNE FUNCTION IN THE BODY AND IS LINKED WITH EARLY DEATH IN PROLONGED USERS. ( I might add that a good majority Do end up long term users because the withdrawl symptoms are emotionally and physically intensel and because the pain of them is stopped instantly by taking the pills again ZOPICLONE CAN PRODUCE PROTRACTED WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS THAT CAN LAST ON AND OFF FOR YEARS WITH NO CURE AND THIS SUBSEQUENTLY CAN CAUSE RELAPSE. People can suffer for years with the withdrawal syndrome repeating and relenting over time, neurologicaly everyone has a different brain and body system so it depends how a persons body reacts to recovery. Zopiclone are a direct assault on the central nervous system and the gamma receptors in our brain that regulate chemicals that are vital in helping you stay calm naturally or go to sleep. Sleep deprivation has been used as torture in the past for good reason. The withdrawal effects are not only felt at night but all day long as well which makes me personally stressed and unable to relax, twitchy and utterly depressed , craving the next dose for the relief that is in it. ZOPICLONE PLAY HAVOC WITH EMOTIONS AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE PEOPLE DEPRESSED AND STRESSED ZOPICLONE CAN WORSEN THE INSOMNIA THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING WITH. ECG MONITORING BRAIN ACTIVITY SHOWED PATIENTS ON ZOPICLONE HAD UNUSUAL BRAIN WAVE ACTIVITY INDICATING THE SLEEP PATTERN NEUROLOGICALLY WAS DIFFERENT FROM A NATURAL SLEEP THEREFORE THE PATIENT WAS NOT GETTING QUALITY REST. This is just the effects bodily, the pain is just beginning for the trusting patient who initially finds the drug effective for insomnia and with the added bonus of feeling wonderfully relaxed and at peace before sleeping (better than any glass of wine one starts to notice). All of the above are not the only evils this drug brings onto your body, they also have a terrible effect on the MIND. I speak from experience of being on this drug for more than 5 yrs. It started innocently and I did not abuse the drug or willfully set out to become a drug addict. I have usually got a strong sense of right and wrong . alcohol has never been a problem for me and I rated myself as fairy responsible in that I would not easily become addicted, how ever, addiction was not mentioned or the horrors above when i was prescribed this on repeat prescription for years! I was just given no info and I trusted my dr as I thought they had an understanding these days that gps do not prescribe addictive drugs since the vaium epidemic of the 50's, seems the lesson was not learned in some cases. I now struggle with the embarrassment of visiting my gp to ask for this medicine which he does not want to prescribe. I feel I have lost all respect for myself and I no longer feel I am treated with the same respect as I was previously from the doctors. I have been honest and disclosed the fact I am addicted to these pills and this fall is so painfully felt in the completely different way I am treated now. I have become the enemy it almost seems. I have in desperation tried to have my prescription a few days earlier as I have ran out, never more than a few days but the doctors do not sympathise or even talk to me or offer counselling on this , instead I receive a humiliating letter being told off like a child threatened with expulsion. It always seems to look like I am the most deceitful person in the world conning drs , it is awful because I am an honest person with feelings . None of the drs take any responsibility that I did not end up this ill on my own, now it feels like this is totally my fault , even though I followed the instructions given and took no more or less. I find mysef now relegated to the status of junkie which is a killer blow to my self esteem.. Receptionists and pharmacists are wary and suspicious after reading the drug on the prescription, fine before but not after. The social judgement is the worst to take and I only take my pills at home and noone knows except immediate family and the people handling the prescriptions. IF YOU FIND YOURSELF PRESCRIBED ANY DRUG IT WOULD ALWAYS BE MY ADVICE TO INVESTIGATE IMMEDIATELY BEFORE TAKING , ANY PILL OR DRUG FROM THE DR AS I ENDED UP HERE BECAUSE OF SIMPLY FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN BY THE DOCTOR RELIGIOUSLY UNTIL i WAS ADDICTED.. I HOPE WHAT I HAVE RESEARCHED AND SHARED WILL HELP SOMEONE MAKE A GOOD DECISION. I ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO LEAVE ME A MESSAGE OR CONTACT ME AS I SADLY FEEL LIKE AN EXPERT IN THIS ZOPICLONE ADDICTION NOW SO ID BE HAPPY TO BE THERE FOR ANYONE IN THEIR STRUGGLE TOO. tAKE CARE X"

        " Sounds like you've got a raging H. pylori infection, you need antibiotics for this. (If it's really really raging / painful) a Gastroscopy (an endoscope down the Throat and into the Stomach) to get an idea of it's true extent would be very helpful. If you are of modest means then some Generic Soluble Paracetamol could hit the spot, if you are a bit more minted then I'd go for Soluble Solpadeine Max,, do [b]not[/b] take Ibuprofen, Aspirin or Diclofenac (or any other NSAID), nor use any creams or gels containing these drugs... patient.info/health/Helicobacter-Pylori-and-Stomach-Pain.htm Look afters :) Thanku so much for your reply, however I was tested for h pylori virus two weeks ago my results came back last Friday saying negative for h pylori. Pain is worse than ever before today so have had to leave work and come home, I have docs appt at 4 and will ask to be referred as I thankfully have bupa ins, managed to get an appt with stomach specialist for tomorrow. Terrified it's something serious :-s  In that case then the Endoscopy is definitely the way to go. If you've been well in every other respect then I doubt it's anything 'serious', the worst it could be is a substantial Stomach Ulcer, they'll biopsy your Stomach when you have the Endoscopy (depending on how close they're taken from near the scabby bits the biopsies don't hurt) ;)  Thanku, I hope your right! Stomach pain has died down again now just feels bruised and tender, fingers crossed for my appt tomorrow! Will keep u posted  Ok so its been just over two weeks since my last post and this is whats been happening and where I am now... I went to the doctors on Friday 25/10 and got referred to a private hospital THANKFULLY (finding the nhs doctors not very helpful at all if im honest). So Saturday 26/10 I went and saw a stomach specialist, he listened to all my symptoms and what I had been going through and how long, I also told him about the Lansoprazole which wasn't working at all (which he said if its not working, stop taking it which I did), he examined my stomach (felt it) and booked me in for an Ultrasound which was on Wednesday 30/10 and an Endsocopy on Wednesday 06/11, he didn't comment on what it could be as he said he needed to run these tests first. I asked him what I could do for the pain in the mean time, he said he didn't know as he didn't know what was wrong, which is a fair comment but to maybe try paracetmol and see if that helps. So the pain in my stomach was still feeling horrendous, flaring up general mornings and afternoons to the point it would make me get extremely upset and not knowing what to do with myself, on Sunday 27/10 so much so I just said to my other half pls just look online and see what I can do to cope! I seriously didn't think I was going to make it to either of the coming appointments. I get upset stomach a couple of times a day too which added to the worry. He looked online and said it sounds like I have an ulcer so basically said to me to eat every 2 hours (little and often), stop drinking tea (I only have 4 a day anyway) so I have exchanged it for 3 green teas a day, I used to have 1 can of sprite in the evening with my dinner which I have stopped as you shouldn't drink fizzy drinks, I have stopped eating spicy foods, I used to smoke 5 cigarettes a day which I have reduced by 1 so now smoke 4 a day and only have one after eating... Long story short it this seems to of stopped my stomach flaring into mega pain however the pain is still there but luckily it enabled me to go to work etc. So I had the ultrasound, ALL CLEAR! which was a massive relief as I was petrified they was going to pick up something bad... he checked ALL my organs and said it all looks absolutely fine, which was a huge relief however they don't pick up stomach ulcers on an ultrasound so I still needed an endoscopy to see what was going on inside my stomach however the relief I had that the scan was all clear. So it felt like a week took forever to roll round until the Endoscopy, Wednesday 6th November was finally here, which I was extremely nervous about as the thought of having a camera down my throat into my stomach which was sooooooo painful was terrifying, my apt was at 3.15 and I wasn't allowed to eat for 6 hours before hand. I had the endoscopy under Sedation (which didn't fully work) however it didn't take them long to do it and the doctor and nurses were amazing and really put me at ease. To be honest I was just glad when it was all over, however my results were ALL CLEAR! No ulcer and from what he said my stomach all looked fine! Well in a way it was lovely to hear however what is this pain I have been getting! So as you can imagine I am no further forward really, my stomach is still extremely tender I feel sick all of the time, I have a lump in my throat I am eating and drinking all the right things (as far as im concerned) I have had the all clear on all tests so far WHAT DO I DO ? The consultant didn't have time to see me after the endoscopy, so now im booked in to see him on Monday 25/11 yes another two weeks away :( I am pinning so much on this apt, I can't surely live with this pain for the rest of my life, I don't want to go out or do anything its a struggle to come to work and I am just sick of not feeling well. The one thing that I have changed in my life since xmas is I started taking Asda's own A-Z Vitamins and Minerals, could I per allergic maybe? I stopped taking these on Thursday 07/11 however to date haven't noticed a difference in how I feel, how long should I leave it for to see if it is them? Other than that I just don't know :( All advise and comments gratefully received Hm funny that, based on what you were / are saying your Stomach should have something to um and ah at :| I know, I thought the exact thing, how can I have so much pain yet nothing be there? As I say the consultant didn't see me after like he was meant to and I have an apt with him Monday week, however I would of thought he would of told me something after the endoscopy? How much weight have you (unintentionally) lost [???] :)  Oh [:[] A nurse usually just gives you a tick box report after an Endoscopy (with your GP receiving a report in a few weeks), seeing the actual Consultant afterwards would be, er, unheard of, they're far too busy to talk to the mere punters ^_  I haven't lost or gained any weight I am exactly the same, as much as I feel sick I have been eating regularly (I am a creature of habbit anyway!) Well I went privately and when the I saw the consultant he said that I would have the endoscopy (by him) and then he would see me afterwards to tell me what he saw... however on the day the apt before me over over ran so I think that's why he had to shoot off hence why he booked me in to see him Monday week.  I'm not sure what is going on with you, but a few years ago I had unexplained gastritis that the doctors did not take seriously. Everything I ate caused nausea than diarrhea. I was losing a lot of weight and since I am already naturally underweight, I didn't have much to spare. I finally was prescribed marinol, which helped with keeping food down, but if I didnt take it the symptoms returned.. I eventually completely modified my diet and did a yeast cleanse (no sugar (grains) and certain yeast friendly foods) for 2 weeks. Then I went on the Paleo diet. My symptoms disappeared.. I don\u2019t know if this works for you.. but it sounds like you\u2019ve tried a lot of the harder stuff already. Hi Rose, Thank you for writing, How long did your gastritis go on for in total? Luckily I haven't been sick as yet even though I feel on the edge of being sick all the time, however I do get a constant upset stomach. The Paleo diet sounds interesting, have you stayed on that diet ever since? I am finding that since I have been eating every two hours (little and often) it has helped, however I still get upset stomach in the mornings and every early evening, strange as its generally always the same sort of time and mixing up what I eat doesnt' seem to change that either.  I stayed on the Paleo diet for 6 months. I had to stop because I got married, and my husband was not as supportive of my diet. It became too hard to continue it when the other person in the house continued questioning its effectiveness. I really believed that it helped though and always recommend it to anyone with stomach problems. When I stopped doing it, I was okay for about 4 months, then the symptoms started to come back.I struggle with gastritis occasionally now... So that would be 3 years now.. but of those three years I spent 18 months of it pregnant and 6 months of it on the diet. I did not have the symptoms when I was pregnant. I agree, smaller meals should help. You are making it easier on your digestive system when you eat smaller meals.  Jenny: My wife has twice had a similar problem to you. First time she was admitted to hospital and like you had all the tests. Nothing found t account for the pain. I suggested that she take Aloe Vera and after a few weeks it worked. When she had a follow up appointment the consultant was non committal about her remedy. He had some students with him and he asked her to wait until they discussed her case. We could hear them through the partition. One said that her mother had gone through a similar episode and had been helped by Aloe Vera. She commented that her mother said that it is expensive but worth it. Three years ago my wife had the same symptoms again and went through the same tests plus a CT scan. Again nothing was found. She has been taking Aloe Vera every day since. She has stopped it a few times when on holiday etc but has been glad to get back on to it so now takes capsules away with her."

        "I wondered if anyone could help me, since about January 2013 I have on and off had a dull ache in my stomach, sometimes flaring up to make me feel sick. I actually put this down to anxiety however in the past few weeks my theory has changed. About three weeks ago my stomach flared up however to the worst pain I have experienced as yet, made me feel like I was going to be sick constantly and made me not know what to do with myself. I feel like there is a lump in my thought and my stomach feels tender and swollen when flares up feels like my stomach is on fire/knotted up! The pain was so sever I went to the doctors (2 and a half weeks ago), my doctor felt my stomach and said it felt swollen, I told her the symtoms and she says she thinks I have gastritis and prescribed me with Lansoprazole 30mg tablets to take daily for 1 month, this however to date hasn't helped my stomach at all, the flare up comes and goes however the pain in my stomach is constant and the Lansorprazole is causing terrible upset stomach to the point I am worried to not be near a toilet. I went back to the doctors on Tuesday 22/10 explained all of the above to her and she said I am to keep taking the tablets and she is happy to see me again in November (once the months course has been taking) however im in dispear with this pain :( HAD ENOUGH OF FEELING ILL and can't help but think the worse Has anyone experienced symptoms same as above as I feel extremely on my own shouting and no one understanding what im going though Comments greatfully received."

        " Hi, I hope this will help, as I was very interested to hear your case. I started with a fever of 38'C about 3 1/2 weeks ago, with no cough but a horrible headache and aches and pains and severe lethargy. I immediately isolated in the spare room as my son may be at risk. The headache soon went, but the temperature would come and go, and I was still really tired and unable to do much. After two weeks I spoke to the doctor, who said to stick it out for another week. I then got worse, much more tired and tightness and pain in my chest, but still breathing OK. Temperature was almost constantly at 38. Finally I've been prescribed antibiotics, and the temperature is still around but not constant. This time the Dr said that he didn't think it was Coronavirus as it doesn't go on this long with a temperature. I'm usually quite fit and active, not overweight and no underlying health issues. Like you I am tearing my hair out and no idea what is going on, or when I'm going to recover.  Res and Julie, yours are the first first-hand stories I've heard, interesting that you have similar descriptions. I do not have anything specific to add. But some questions. First, if you can give some idea of your location? Second, are there any nutritional questions the doctors ask? What are you eating now? For that matter, what was your diet like before, and were you taking any vitamins and supplements? Of course zinc has been talked about a lot in regards to the virus. Thanks, and best wishes for you both - and for all in these times. Hi Res I'm on week two now. I have little to no cough, no raised temperature, just constant breathlessness. I've been pretty much bed-bound for these past two weeks. Having said this my condition has been up and down as you describe, I even went back to work for 3 days only for it to hit back yet again. Unlike you though, my sleep has been mostly unaffected, although it is challenging to calm down enough to fall to sleep initially. Saying that, keeping my anxiety levels down while suffering from this breathlessness is a bloody challenge. Like you, I have no underlying health conditions, however I'm mid-20s and am usually fit and healthy. As a result when I eventually went to hospital I was kept for an hour, had my vitals measured and sent home. I can't argue with the decision as I could still talk (although it is challenging to do so) and walk myself out - like yourself I'm getting pretty desperate... I do hope I haven't another two weeks of this! To clarify, I too feel slightly better every so often, even on my worst days, but it soon becomes a challenge to breathe again. As well as this I seem to improve every few days, enough to feel my breathing almost back to normal, only for it to return with bad as ever. Hope you get well soon. "

        "Hi, I've had Covid19 for 4 weeks and if I had the energy I'd be tearing my hair out. I've had 2 sets of prohylactic antibiotics to safeguard against bacterial infections, my temperature has been up and down but never higher than 38 the entire illness. I've had severe neuropathy during the illness and some kind of night seizures accompanying the other more well publicised symptoms that mean my sleep is terrible also. I went to hospital Day 14 after a week of seriously thinking I'm on death's door and my blood oxygen was good enough to be sent home for follow up at the Covid Hubs where they basically just take temperature, pulse and oxygen levels. I was prescribed a 2nd course of antibiotics there as my temperature was still up and they are checking in on me every few days. Meanwhile I am having one better day, then another terrible day, then a better day then a worse day..But 'better' is still bed ridden, just means I can breath well enough and not too dizzy to make myself my own cup of tea, have a shower and engage in some small talk with my family. Everytime I have a good few hours I think, that must be me getting well now, but no, 4 weeks later and the last 24 hrs my breathlessness has been worse than it was for the previous 5 days..Am about ready to shoot myself. Is there anyone else that's experienced being so ill with this virus outside of an ICU setting where it's carried on this long? Even ICU patients are recovering in 3-6weeks . Cannot understand why I'm not getting well yet. I have no underlying health issues and I'm in my 30s. I don't know if I still have Covid or if this is post viral inflammation and fatigue..There is no way of knowing as they are not testing community cases. Every doctor just says it's definitely Covid but I have no idea if I've passed the peak of the illness or if i should still be worried it could get worse. Just feel it's going on forever. Be great to know if there's any non hospital stories of people being sick, as in still unable to do a thing this length of time. Thanks!"

        " Just want to say congratulations, and thanks for the advice x Thank you :) I think it's important to share good news and tips as well as the bad. x It's great to hear that your are of the meds and doing great :). I wish I had come across this before. I have gone completely to zero after a year of taking the meds. I am having the most horrendous withdrawals, that I don't know if to go back on them or continue. I am so scared :( Hi Evyivy, I am so sorry to hear that you're having bad withdrawal symptoms. I know from earlier on that when I tried to reduce my effexor too soon my symptoms were quite nasty - I would not wish that on anyone. Do you mind if I ask how long you have been taking no medication, what dose you decreased from and how rapidly? I really think that your withdrawal symptoms will pass completely if you taper slowly enough. From what I understand taking things slowly is key. Also, if it provides any hope, after about 1.5 to 2 months post effexor I feel great and have had no ongoing side effects. Importantly, do you have a supportive GP who knows about what you're going through? It is always good to check in with them for emotinal and physical support. Perhaps he/she can also help treat some of the side effects (eg with anti-nausea meds). If you have any questions about my experience, I will be happy to let you know. Best of luck - I really hope thngs get better for you soon. xx PS. I was also wondering if anyone has had any luck reducing their weight post-effexor. My weight will not budge, despite diet control and exercise. Any news of positive results would be so wonderful.  hi I am back, sorry for no replying sooner. Thank you, thank you, thank you for your advice. I haven't been able to reply sooner as I became very ill. Going cold turkey from these meds is not a good idea. Although I feel proud of myself as I am now off the meds, it was a very dangerous thing to and I went to hell and back. I am still suffering the withdrawals, today has been particularly bad with the dizzy spells, unsteady vision and brain zaps. I think I was feeling better and then tried to catch up on everything! ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU XXX Hi Evyivy, I'm so glad to hear that things are going better for you! It can be such a scary time, but you will get through it! Good luck with everything- I'll be thinking of you, as I'm sure many others will be! xx G'day Oz82 Your wisdom comes from experience ... and I am so glad when I Googled Venlafaxine withdrawal this morning I clicked on this thread. I have been feeling quite wretched and the strength and support offered by your words came shining through to me. I reached a point a two or three weeks ago when I thought not only was Venlafaxine not controlling my fibromyalgia pains and stress but my body, especially digestive system, was reacting to the point that I wanted to stop it immediately ... which I did. I mentioned it to nobody but know now that the side-effects are a lot to handle on your own. I know the way to go is forwards but have taken from your words some courage to perhaps share some of this burden. Thank you.  Hi - firstly, thank you so much for sharing this! I have been on 225 mg (capsules) per day for the past 8 years. I am now 26 and looking to reduce my dose slowly to come off permanently. Two weeks ago I reduced my dose by 37.5 mg to 187.5 mg per day, and haven't really noticed any side effects until a few days ago when I noticed I was feeling incredibly tired, had a strong headache (very unusual for me) and was very short and irritable with people. Have had no nausea - if anything my appetite has increased! My weight has remained steady throughout my time taking Effexor, and has always been on the low end (BMI = 19.5). My plan is to continue taking 187.5 for the next 2.5 months - I don't think there's anything wrong with taking things slowly and being careful. After all, if you've been on Effexor this long - what's another year to come off it? I have also tried to come off in the past by reducing 37.5 mg per month - had to go back to regular dose once I hit 150 mg. Will try to remember to update later down the track.  I couldn't agree more with oz82. I just came off Effexor 300 mg daily (4 x 75 mg) after 6 years. I tried twice but went way too fast. First time I ended up so badly depressed I could not get out of bed nor eat for almost 2 weeks. But for my boyfriend at the time I don't know what would have happened. Second time I went still a bit too fast and had to swing to a halt at 150 mg due to withdrawal symptoms. I then tapered down to 75 mg with moderate to severe symptoms but hung in there until I stabilized. Then I dropped down to 37.5 mg which was a breeze compared to the 75 mg drops. I waited again until stabilized and then dropped the last 37.5 mg. I have to honestly say, I have a very high tolerance for pain and discomfort but withdrawing from Effexor is not for the faint hearted. The best advice is go slow, slow and slow. I just want to congratulate you. What you have done is commendable and as I know from experience a hard thing to do. I too was on venlafaxine xr 225mg for 8 years. The reasons I was put on it was because of a situation that caused depression, panic attacks which led to seizures and it replaced other medications that I had been on for almost 30 years for the same reason. I have tried to wean off of it twice before but with no help from my gp. I was diagionised with Afib last summer and the cardiologist wanted me off as the venlafaxine was working against my heart medications. Still my gp would not help. I was referred to a Psychiatrist who, thank goodness, agreed with my cardiologist. I started weaning last October 37 1/2 every time the side effects cleared up from the last weaning. I took my last pill the third week of February and although I still have some side effects have had no depression, panic attacks or seizures. I am sure the other side effects will disappear eventually. When I saw my gp for other reasons last week and told him I was off the venlafaxine what did he do but offer me more. Sometimes you just have to wonder."

        "Hi guys, After 6 long years on venlafaxine, I have finally gotten off the drug. I don't know if this will be of any use to anyone, but I wanted to share some hopeful words and tips for anyone trying to come off of this nasty medication. I should clarify, however, that I am not angry for having been put on this medication, as I am sure it saved my life. That being said, 6 years, 225mg/day and an additional 20kg later (!!! just awful !!!) I am so glad to be Effexor free. The details: I was taking Effexor XR and had been on my maximum dose for 3.5 years. Prior to that I was on 150mg for about 2 years. I took 3 x 75mg capsules every morning as a once a day dose. Taking three tablets was initially to save money (for some reason it was cheaper here in Australia to do it that way) but it ended up having the extra bonus of making withdrawal easier. What worked for me may not work for everyone, but this is the approach my GP and I came up with. Most was my own plan, based on what I found worked, but my GP gave me the initial \"tablet dropping\" idea and trusted me to take it slowly, listen to my body and see her as needed. It worked very, very well, with minimal side effects. If it helps even one of you it will be worth having posted this. First things first: 1. Make sure you are taking care of yourself and are in a good place emotionally before even contemplating withdrawal. 2. You are going to need supportive people around you- I don't know if I could have done it without my boyfriend. Tell your family/friends AND DOCTOR what you are doing. This is crucial. You may also want to tell someone you trust at work what is going on, so they know why you may seem a little dazed every so often. 3. Make sure you are eating really well. I switched to a vegan diet about half way through and, although this is not for everyone, this made withdrawal so much easier. I am sure the huge amounts of vegetables made a difference. I especially noticed that days when I ate lots of sea vegetables I coped best with symptoms, so consider working them into your normal diet. 4. Take a multivitamin and drink lots of water. At least 2 litres a day. This will help minimise the horrible nausea you will probably experience. 5. Drink ginger tea/use ginger. This is also for the nausea and I found it was essential in the days after stopping completely. It really does help. I also wondered if some people might find a prescription for maxalon or stemetil helpful, as the nausea and dizziness was the worst for me. 6. Get lots of sleep. I mean heaps of it. Anyone who has withdrawn from this med (or even skipped a dose!) knows how tired you will get. Now the tablet reduction: I started by reducing my total weekly dose by 1 tablet per week (taking 2 tabs one day and 3 every other day) for a few weeks. This sounds like nothing, but even this produced quite bad side effects at first (teariness, exhaustion, dizziness and nausea). Only when I was comfortable (ie no side effects) with this dose regimen did I move on. Then, I took 2 tabs instead of 3 on two days a week for a few weeks until I was comfortable (making sure to space the 2 tablet days out, eg Sat and Wed). Then I got into the habit of taking tablets as follows. I made sure to plan/write all of this down on our calender beforehand, to use as a guide and make sure I didn't mess it up: 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2 etc for about 3 to 4 weeks Then: 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2 etc for about another 3 weeks to month. Then: 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, etc for about a month. Then when I got to 2 tablets (150mg) a day on every day of the week I rested on that for quite a while (mostly as I was nervous about going too fast). Then, I did a pretty much similar thing to get down to one tablet a day. Then the same to get to 37.5 mg. I actually stopped pretty abruptly from the 37.5 mg stage, as I felt entirely ready. After that I had about 5 days of feeling pretty crappy, with symptoms as above, then I started getting better. Day 3 with no drugs was the worst for me. So, in the end, it took me about 8 months to go from 225 to nothing. I know that seems an eternity, but I think that is why I coped so well. Five days after dropping from 37.5mg to nothing, I had almost no symptoms. Seven days later I had none. Even if you take nothing else from this, please know that it is possible to get off of this nasty drug BUT you must be careful, listen to your body, do it with support from those around you and in communication with your GP. Good luck to all of you xx :)) :))"

        " Hi terryw, Without sounding harsh all the stats around the web are fine but the bottom line is you may! Have cancer and the sooner you find out the better it can be dealt with, hopefully successfuly. My psa was 5.2 after biopsy gleason 3,3 (6) after removal T2c RO NO MARGINS This all took place within 2 months diagnosis to removal. Agree not all like to move so quickly but if it is confirmed pads are better than departure from this life. Don't be afraid of thr biopsy the risks are a lot less than the alternatives should you go on undiagnosed and then find iys to late! ! I am 64 for me there was no stepping back Forward get it dealt with. A life in the Army may have helped. All I can say is I had all this done in Grrmany so if I trusted a Germam Urologist I would think your task is easy TRUST your doctor or find another. By yhe way mine was fantastic and its true 4 door techneak really does work! Good these Germans. Well I wish you lots of luck and my advice is go and get it sorted NOW Best of luck Ian G'day TerryW and welcome to the world of indecisiveness... By the sounds of things you have done a pretty good job of convincing yourself NOT to have a biopsy... From a personal viewpoint I have been one of those that has had a biopsy done...it was a quick painless and simple procedure after which I drove myself home and had absolutely NO effects from it whatsoever... :-) Unfortunately I am also one of the so-called 3% that has an aggressive tumor... I truly hope that this is not the situation with you or anyone as I know what's ahead for me...:-( I am a big believer in everyone's right to choices however Prostate Cancer is not something I would ever take lightly... Good luck with you decision making but just remember one thing - I'm now and always a couple of steps behind my cancer and will never catch it...time is an extremely important factor... Hi Terri, this is such a difficult call. Without the Gleason score you cannot assess the competing risks. Without a biopsy you cannot get the Gleason score. I don't think you have had an MRI scan. I am firmly in favour of an MRI scan as part of the information feeding into the decision about a biopsy. Yes, well ... take a look at David 41094 's posts. From their optimistic beginnings, to the ongoing reality check ! Also if you think you are tough enough take a stroll through your local Hospital's Rad/Oncology suite, have a look at the pallor and resigned despair of the Patients, the tubes etc., and then speak to one or two people about dying from terminal Prostate Cancer. Yes, your Consultant does think you are wasting his time because he lives with the disease, trying to preserve both life and it's quality. Yours in fact. And you are a 'Johnny come lately ' trying to intellectualise your way through a maze of statistics, thinking that you will dodge a bullet. Well, you may ...but even so in that event, no-one else can benefit from your good fortune and so you can't really contribute very much to a site like this where many participants are fighting for their lives. Incidentally I assume that at the moment, you are pain-free ? In the meantime, please do us all a favour on this site and don't persist with your hypothetical. Thanks and Regards, Dudley  I entirely agree with your approach. Biopsies are invasive and generally painful. 6 percent of people will require hospitalisation as a result of sepsis and one in a thousand people will die as a direct result of the biopsy. I would recommend a scan which will provide at least as much useful information. Only then would I consider a TARGETED biopsy. The prostate is the only part of the body which is routinely biopsies without prior imaging - madness in my opinion, especially given that it is typically trans-rectal. I would read 'Prostate cancer breakthroughs' by Jay Cohen MD which gives a step-by-step approach to diagnosis and treatment. I wish you well. It seems likely that posts on PCa and an acceptance of and concurrence with Professional Medical Advice ; as opposed to individual interpretations of statistics and deferrment of treatment, will continue on this Site and so it may be helpful to try and clear away some of the fog of generalization : It is acknowledged and accepted within the Medical Profession that unilaterally there are no empirical studies on PSA/Biopsy/ infection rates/ treatment/mortality et al. And this lack of uniformity produces unclear Clinical Data. Currently for example, statistics on infection do not necessarily show the age bracket, ethnic origins, or underlying health status of the Patient, nor what the biopsy's resultant Gleason score was for that Patient. Just as an example, in my case I was given to understand that as my underlying general health status is pretty good then even though I'm in my early seventies, I would not be at contra- indicatory procedural risk. And so it was. But hypothetically if I were say in my late seventies/early eighties and had diabetes and a cardiac condition and therefore had an impaired immune system, then I might easily have sustained an infection/death. And that's not to say that even with that underlying scenario I didn't need the urgent Prostate assessment, seeing as how I'd been ignoring impaired flow for a long time and now presented with no-flow urinary symptoms, suspected to be caused by a Prostate tumor. What seems to me as being most relevant in choosing a way forward, is the Provisional Diagnosis, Opinion and Recommendation of your Consultant. He/She will have assessed you, your current general health status, your medical and Family history, your test results and your symptoms if any. Based on years of Training, Continuous Study, Practical Experience and Peer Review Consultations, the most expedient and beneficial course of treatment will be recommended for you. Those initial consultations when they are focusing intensely on you Terry, are vital. And if they thought you were at increased risk of infection, they would definitely appraise you of that. Having been through the process and during that from what I was given to understand generally, your particular type of PSA velocity creep is pretty much indicative that you have a PCa issue to address or at the very least, illiminate. What you don't want, is for slow-growing PCa to turn aggressive on you. And it can and does. And you DEFINITELY don't want to die of an un-treated PCa. that you could have completely knocked off inside 6-12 months, were it not for the confusing muddle of inconclusive statistics you are wading through. To conclude, I quote you : ' ... and at my age quality of life is more important than lifespan '. Well, I'm sorry to tell you that if what may well have been a slow-growing PCa is turning aggressive on you, you will not have a quality of life,r a life-span.  Terry I read with great interest your posting and the very first thing that struck me and that George and another has pointed out is the issue of an MRI Scan. Another key fact that you mention is that you have an Enlarged Prostate. A major problem in the NHS at many of their hospitals is this insistence that they Biopsy before they do an MRI Scan. If you attend any of the major specialist centres or if you speak with leading Urologists around the UK you will find that they all recommend an MRI before biopsy. In addition to the MRI many places also offer the PCA3 Urine test. A combination of both of these non invasive tests can put your mind at ease on the risk of you having Prostate Cancer and subsequently requiring a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis. A major problem with biopsies taken before MRI's is that even if a positive result is found you will still need that MRI scan to determine the extent of the cancer. The trauma of the biopsy often means you have to wait several months for the prostate to settle down to enable a more clear scan to be taken, often leading to more anxiety. For you peace of mind, I would recommend seeing if you can get an \"Enhanced MRI\" and a PCA3 test. Neither of these tests were available to me in 2012 when I had my surgery. I just had the standard MRI after my biopsy. My surgeon/urologist told me that he would have preferred me to have had the scan before the biopsy. Due to the trauma of the biopsy my scan only showed cancer on the right of my prostate. When it was removed there was considerably more cancer on the left and the apex - this wasnt seen on the scan due to the biopsy. So get a Scan first and then sit with your consultant and decide upon next steps after that. Also, try not to worry. You say you ahev an enlarged prostate. I am assuming you are on medication to reduce that? You wouldnt do anything until your prostate has reduced in size anyway. Are they giving you an MRI for your Enlarged Prostate or are you just relying on an ultrasound? I would highly recommend that if you are worried you give the help line at Prostate Cancer UK a call. The clinical nurses who man that service are excellant and can answer any worries you might have. Best regards Eddie"

        "Introduction I\u2019m 70 and have a PSA which was at 4.6 when I was 66, and while it has been regularly monitored over the past 18 months or so has been moving up and down between 6 and 7. My doctor thought that I should be referred and I have had two hpital appointments, but I have so far decided against having a prostate biopsy, though it is obvious that my local hospital\u2019s oncology department would like me to have one. The health worker I saw at my first hospital appointment was happy to discuss the issue with me, but I suspect the consultant I just saw probably thought I should stop wasting his time and get booked in for a biopsy without further delay. I have received information from those two appointments, but I have obtained much more information from online research. Based on studying a number of online medical reports over the period 2008 \u2013 2014, it is evident that there is increasing prejudice, at least in the US and Australia, against the use of prostate biopsies. The primary reasons for this seem to be an increasing risk of serious infections from the most common type of biopsy, a growing recognition (though this may be controversial) that psa screening and biopsies are ineffective in reducing the incidence of terminal prostate cancer, and that screening and biopsies contribute to massive \u2018over treatment\u2019 of prostate cancers Summary of Statistics (some of which may be controversial but all of which are based on (my interpretation of) studies published in urological journals, research reviews and conference speeches by leading urologists). Of every 100 men who have a prostate biopsy: \u00b7 97 didn\u2019t need it (that is, they don\u2019t have a prostate cancer requiring treatment) \u00b7 6 will get a serious infection as a result (a figure which has doubled in recent years), which will cause them to be hospitalised, and from which a very occasional man will die, while others (we don\u2019t know how many) will have persistent painful side effects \u00b7 between 17 and 22 will be offered treatment that they don\u2019t need, as a result of which about 25% of men in their 70s will become incontinent or impotent. The Perceived Indicators for Biopsy Primarily a raised psa; a psa which has increased rapidly over a fairly short period, typically a year; smoking; family history of prostate cancer; age (considered with the other factors). I have a raised psa, but it\u2019s not dramatically high \u2013 it\u2019s been between 6 and 7 over the past 1 \u00bd years, and it has not increased dramatically \u2013 it was 4.6 five years ago. I do smoke, and I am 70, but I am generally in good health, and there is no history of prostate cancer in my family that I know of. Statistics Based on Recent Urological Papers Of every 100 men who have a biopsy, between 75 and 80 have no cancerous cells and didn\u2019t need the procedure; 20 to 25 will have cancerous cells found on biopsy BUT a large percentage of these men will have a tumour which develops very slowly, will not be terminal and doesn\u2019t really need any treatment. Only a small percentage will have an aggressive tumour requiring immediate intervention; the Harvard School of Public Health, in a 2014 paper, put this percentage at 10 \u2013 15%, or 3 men out of the 100. This means only 3 out of every 100 men who have a biopsy really needed it. And there are two other real concerns. 1. The one certainty with prostate biopsies is that 100% of the men who have them will have \u2018side effects\u2019. Some will be shortlived and not really a problem, but some will be painful and longer lasting, and some men, currently about 6 out of the 100, will be hospitalised with serious infections, and the very occasional one will die. There are no statistics for the number of men receiving treatment for post-biopsy infections at doctors\u2019 surgeries. I don\u2019t necessarily see this as a reason not to have a biopsy, because obviously if you really need a biopsy to diagnose a terminal cancer then it\u2019s worth putting up with the side effects. But do you really need it? 2. Most worryingly, doctors apparently can\u2019t tell from the biopsy result whether cancerous cells denote an aggressive tumour which requires immediate treatment, or a slow developing tumour which probably does not need any treatment. As a result, as I understand it, all patients with cancerous cells may generally be assumed to need immediate treatment, such as hormone replacement, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, even though 85-90% of them don\u2019t need any treatment. Research papers suggest that in men in their 70s, 25% who have this treatment will become incontinent or impotent as a result. Many of these men will suffer these consequences despite the fact that they didn\u2019t ever need the treatment they were subjected to. It\u2019s also worrying that at two hospital appointments the issue of what happens after the biopsy has not been raised, even though it was clear that both the people I saw thought I should have a biopsy. Maybe they would say that it would have been raised if and when I agreed to a biopsy, but given concerns about receiving unnecessary treatment, I feel it should have been raised at the time the issue of having a biopsy was raised. Would they have explained to me that if cancerous cells were found, they might not be able to tell whether I needed treatment or not? Would they have told me that there was a risk (if not a certainty?) that I would be \u2018offered\u2019 treatment that I might not need? Since they did not have that conversation with me I cannot answer those questions. Conclusions My psa is raised but not highly raised and it didn\u2019t move up fast, so I feel it is not at present a firm indicator of the need for a prostate biopsy \u2013 it\u2019s inconclusive. The only additional risk factor I have is that I smoke, and I suspect that is often overplayed by the NHS. According to NHS statistics, I should be suffering the ill effects of smoking by the age of 70, in the form of early signs of lung cancer, but when I had a chest scan a year ago it was clear. In addition I have an enlarged prostate \u2013 which was determined at my first hospital visit not to feel cancerous \u2013 which means I would have a heightened psa anyway. I have been offered another appointment by the hospital in six months, and I am going to take that up, but unless things change I think that has to be the last for the moment. It\u2019s pointless me trooping up to the hospital every six months when I don\u2019t want a biopsy \u2013 which is all they can do by way of diagnosis \u2013 and there could be people with aggressive tumours urgently needing those appointments. So I need to decide over the next six months finally, whether I am going to have a biopsy or not. The hospital has asked me to have another psa blood test before I go for the 6 month appointment, but I have asked my GP for three-monthly psa tests, so that I can get more of a feel for movement on the results before I go for the hospital appointment. If my psa is suddenly moving up rapidly over the next six months, then, depending how fast and how far it is moving, I may agree to a biopsy. Otherwise it is unlikely that I will, in which case there is not much point in the hospital continuing to see me \u2013 though I will ask my local surgery to continue monitoring me with 4 or 6-monthly psa tests. At the age of 70 I still work full-time (for myself), and having unnecessary treatment for prostate cancer would certainly have far more of an impact on my life than having a slow developing prostate cancer which would not affect my health or life expectancy, and might even have more of an impact in the short term than having an aggressive prostate tumour. So it\u2019s a numbers game. None of us is going to live forever, and at my age quality of life is more important than lifespan. Younger doctors especially often don\u2019t take account of this, and assume that keeping you breathing, no matter what state you are in, is some sort of medical triumph. Not surprisingly, there are lots of older people who don\u2019t see it that way!"

        " hi i had my gallbladder removed in 1990 and have had problems with the bowel ever since. but apart from my very closest family i never spoke about it until last year 2011 in december i had a sehcat test done and was diagnosed with bile salt malabsorption i also have b12 anemia which i think is connected has it is the same site that both are absorbed in. my own research through the net. but even if i was told that i would end up with permanent bowel problems i would still of had the operation because i was ill in the end. 21yrs i suffered in silence due to embarrassment what an idiot i was i feel better just knowing my accidents are not my fault im only 44yrs old now, so i suppose the older you get the less you are willing to leave things ,i think that the ratio of people left with problems after gallbladder removal is alot higher than what is recorded it is just hard to speak about when you are young sorry for the ramble finely ive come to terms with this all the best to you . yes i put weight on after and have never managed to loose it again and im busy,i go walking the gym and swimming. just easier not to eat if going somewere,so as not to have an accident wether this makes the weight worse probably does metabolism an all that. I also have this condition, but I loose weight not gain it, we are all different, not sure if you great people are aware of the help with toilets if you need them, here are a few I have found :- The National Key Scheme (RADAR) gives you access to public toilets for disabled people throughout the country. These are very useful and you can buy a key by visiting their website at www.radar.org.uk NACC - Card \u00a3 12.00 for the pack www.nacc.org.uk/content/home.asp phone apps to find a toilet - www.betomorrow.com/2011/09/02/ou-sont-les-toilettes/ free hope this helps I had my gallbladder removed 2 yrs ago. I've had constant problems with my bowel ever since. I haven't lost weight, I've gained it. Some weeks have diarrahoea other times I am constipated. Been told its a side effect of the op. Some people get better others don't. I just got presribed Colestyramine for this condition .. early days but seems to be helping so far as it helps with the absorption so that food doesn't pass through quite as quickly! Might be worth talking to your doctor about it. There is more than one reason why people have body parts, namely a gall bladder and doctors play with peoples lives as if they are dealing with mechanical objects taking things out of peoples body and not replacing them. Doctors and scientists can do anything these days but they dont want to create an artificial gall bladder with all its entire functions because it will cost them money. On the other hand they can create artificial hearts and valves - who are they to judge what organs people need or dont need. They tell you that you dont need your gall bladder but as you all know it from experience, you do. If all the people took some action we would all go a long way. They could just take out the stones just like they do from a kidney without unecessarily removing it and do the same with the gall bladder and stitch it up inside but nooo, they want to be efficient and save money.....by making patients, you suffer. As you can see the gall bladder is a very important organ, apart from the usual it also has bowel and weight regulation function, it has an affect on hormones and other body parts. After the doctor has done his job in theatre, which is not to cure the problem but to make it worse, which they wont admit to, are the side effects you suffer from this surgery. They usually do not have an answer to your problems after the operation. They will give 101 excuses and blame other things or your other perfectly healthy system. They will not want to admit the side effects are true nor will they want to deal with it anymore. The short answer is you have stones, take out the whole thing. Has it not occured to anyone with an average intellience, you need your gall bladder and removing it is not the answer. Even when the gall bladder is removed you continue to accumulate stones. The problem is not the gall bladder. The problem is diet - you need more fibre and water and eat healthy. If you dont do that you're liver will get congested and as result bile flowing from the liver will be sluggish and if there is not enough water and too much of the wrong type of waste it will harden and turn to stone. The liver and diet is the cause of gall bladder disease not the gall bladder and removing the gall bladder wont do any good but to make problems worse. The main problem is if the gall bladder is removed bile will flow down through the digestive systen and into the bowels, over time, this will cause irritation and will get worse which will result in bowel problems. Patients need to do everything to get a replacement gall bladder if they opt to have it out otherwise go for conservative treatment, if a lot of pressure is applied on the doctors they will do what you want them to. i also had my gallbladder removed back in 2011,and last june was diagnosed with Bile salt malabsorption. looking back i think i may have had it beforehand,but having my gallbladder removed just made the symptoms alot worse.i went from constantly going the toilet to living my whole day running up and down the stairs going at least 20 times a day. now im finding i have put weight on, although i follow a very healthy diet,eating alot of fresh fruit and veg,using the slimming world diet, i go to the gym at least 3 times a week,i dont drive so walk everywhere,nd go to aqua fit,yet i cant lose weight no matter how hard im trying. i have been on colystyramene since last june so symtoms are now under control but feel im not getting anywhere.
