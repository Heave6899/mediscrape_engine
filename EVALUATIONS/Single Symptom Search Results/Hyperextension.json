          " I think I can help you..I am an RN and previous neck pain patient. I am pretty confident I know what nastiness you are dealing with...functional cervical instability due to forward head posture...the physicians are giving you symptoms of a much bigger problem that will have to be addressed before your symptoms get better.. you may have good days and then it will return because the issue is still there. the pain under the earlobe is probably from an overworked sternocleidomastoid that has trigger points...the trembling you feel in the neck....functional cervical instability due to weak deep neck flexors, feeling like your neck is really working to keep your head up...probably because it is...forward head posture can also displace the lower jaw....it can create a tight stiff neck that makes it difficult to fully rotate left and right, it can causing bulging discs in the lower cervical spine and reverse curve in the neck which you have...imaging usually does not lead to a diagnosis of forward head posture...it leads Doctors to diagnose what they can see, \"Oh, you have a bulging disc, etc., \" Addressing only what you can see, in cases like this, usually fail to eliminate the source of someone's discomfort because what caused all them problems is going unaddressed. If left unaddressed this can lead to tight, painful muscle spasms head to toe. This is because the body is trying to compensate for some other muscle/muscles not doing their job...these muscle imbalances are collectively called upper and lower cross syndrome. Chiropractic care is good at alignment and decompression but unless you have a program implemented that stretches and strengthens specific muscles groups, the bones and muscles will return to their faulty ways. A trained physical therapist who is well versed in muscular imbalances can help you with this...trust me when I say not all therapist are equal...I went thru several before I found the right one...it will be important to stretch and strengthen the correct muscles...a proper assessment by a physical therapist can tell you what you need to work on...do not follow recipe approaches from the internet...this can create more symptoms and further dysfunction...no one can tell you without an assessment...strengthening of the deep neck flexors should difinitely be a part of that program to gain stability in the neck... I have had this, and I can tell you the symptoms can be very bizarre..dizzy, off balance, pain at the base of the skull, kind of nauseated, constantly feeling the need to self manipulate neck, heavy headed, foggy headed, blurry vision, awful headaches, many trigger points, and much much more. It is a mess really, and it can get much much worse. Forward head posture can cause the upper trapezius and subocciptials to get very tight (darn painful)...they are working hard when the head is too far forward...this can cause the upper cervical vertebrae to move into hyperextension making it difficult to rotate down to look at paperwork, a computer, etc., When this happens loss of sensorimotor control can be a huge issue (in a nutshell the nervous system goes haywire)...forward head posture does not develop overnight (this is years of abuse), and it does not go away overnight...it takes a lot of reading, work, and patience...It took me more than 2 years to fix the daily discomfort with the help of a physical therapist...give yourself frequent breaks from computer work, avoid sleeping on multiple pillows and avoid slouching posture....your neck would probably benefit from a break... and find an awesome physical therapist...your Doctors have already ruled out anything life threatening...It is worth a shot.Good Luck to you! I hope this information serves you well. If you have any further questions feel free to ask."

          "Ok so last summer I was walking 6 miles a day pushing my 18month old in his stroller up and down hills , losing weight and getting in shape then suddenly I got sick . I woke up on a Thursday morning and had a cold , no big deal but then by Sunday morning I was in terrible pain ! I had this horrible pain behind both ears just under my ear lobe , it felt like something inside my head was swollen and pushing out against my ears . I went to the ER cause it kept getting worse . They checked me everything was fine no fever and ears looked great . Couple days later I followed up with my dr and by now the pressure wasn't just behind my ears anymore it was in my whole head ! Felt like my head was in a vise and when I laid down it felt like someone was standing on my head and my neck was fighting to pick my head up . They did a ct scan all was normal ! After a week of no sleep and constant head pain it slowly went away ! 2 weeks later it came back , had an MRI and it was normal ! Now I was also shaking inside , somewhat trembling in my neck and head felt like my brain was shaking back and forth but my head doesn't move . Since then I have seen an ENT neurologist cardiologist 2 chiropractors and a TMJ specialist , neurologist told me its stress and TMJ dr says it's my jaw and chiropractor says I have reverse curve in my neck and bulging discs in my lower neck . Mri showed those findings and I can feel my jaw is out of place when I open my mouth and I do clench my teeth when I sleep but the biggest concern I have is this shaking feeling , I can't tell where it's coming from it feels like my pulse but when I check my pulse its way slower than this feeling I have that comes and goes . Any ideas what's wrong with me ?"

          " <p>Dear friend...I think I know better than anyone the misery of neck pain because I have had it. I have learned a lot about the neck pain thru my experience as a nurse and first hand as a neck pain patient...So...let me tell you what I do know about whiplash/ neck pain. Most neck pain is musculoskeletal in nature given they didn&#39;t find some other source of your pain on imaging...the main culprit of neck pain is the deep neck flexors that become weakened when a person experiences pain of any kind. When the extensors at the back of the neck become excessively tight it puts these deep neck flexors on stretch and further lengthens and weakens them. This creates a muscular imbalance between the neck and the head resulting in forward head posture and cervical instability as the deep neck flexors are the core stabilizing muscles of the neck...the head becomes unstable on the neck and the skull/occiput can become hyperextended on the atlas called the OA joint ...and you can also have hyperextension thru C1-C2 and lower....the pain comes from the hyperextension and spasms that can compress on neurovascular structures in the upper neck, however trying to work on these tight muscles will never fix the problem unless you work on the deep neck flexors...they are the culprit and most people and even some therapist will try to help their patients by focusing only on the areas of pain...chasing areas of pain will never give lasting results....the best thing one can do for neck pain is specific exercises...there is no manipulation, no pill, no procedure that will give you lasting results if you don&#39;t fix the dysfunction...it sounds to me like you need lots of work on your deep neck flexors...extensors are too tight and when your looking up you are further compressing structures in the neck as the skull falls back on the neck... The specific exercises needed are very hard to explain and need to be done under the guidance of someone experienced and has the patience of a saint...don&#39;t give up on this...find you someone who can help you...But definitely don&#39;t do nothing as this can get much worse...if the head isn&#39;t straight these imbalances will spiral down into the shoulders all the way down to your feet...it can get darn uncomfortable.</p>"

          " Hi i have been advised not to attempt breast stroke by both my consultant and physio, it will put too much pressure on your joint at this early stage. Also have you worked out how you are going to get in and out of pool. If it\u2019s via a ladder , you may struggle to get in and especially when you get out. I love swiming howver doing doing a lot of floating and walking up and down pool but it\u2019s great for exercises we have to do  <p>Hi Pennypops! I swim too but more free and butterfly style. I found I had to adjust my kick a lot in the beast stroke to a more one sided correct form on my non operated knee. I just don&#39;t have the ability to bend my replaced knee enough yet to do the proper kick. I think it will improve in time. If you aren&#39;t competing, then your form really shouldn&#39;t matter. Do the best you can and get back to what you love is my advice. For me, it&#39;s riding horses first (I got back up in a saddle at 9 weeks) everything else after. It really had a positive impact on my mental outlook over the entire recovery process, which takes up to a year!</p> The happiest day post of for me post op will be the day I can swim again!, i swim 3 times a week and do aqua aerobics (hopping on one leg)....im v lucky that my pool has accessible walk in steps so getting in/ out is no issue ....breast stroke a no for anyone with knee probs but its not good generally for neck and back,,,,, you could do the arms with a straight leg kick? . I feel swimming has saved me from having further joint problems with my arthritis over the tears ,,enjoy ur dip  <p>There had been some talk about this on the Forum about a year ago.&#160; Not a great search engine here so I can&#39;t seem to find the discussion.&#160; However, if I recall...</p><p></p><p>Swimming is GREAT for rehab but the breaststroke can put extra pressure on the knee early on so it would be best to avoid&#160;it at the beginning.&#160; Golfers who have back fusions are forbidden to swing a club the first six months and then proceed gradually for the rest of the first year.&#160; The same rule might apply.</p><p></p><p>Some docs say the breaststroke is off limits while others say approach it gradually.&#160; I don&#39;t think that super-strenuous or competitive-level swimming would be OK.&#160; But you have another option.</p><p></p><p>Research what the stress forces on the knee would be due to the breaststroke.&#160; Hyperextension? Torquing?&#160; Then call the donjoy&#160;company and get the number of a local rep.&#160; This is the #1 brace maker on the planet.&#160; Find out which brace will help avoid the banned movement.&#160; Example:&#160; I played hockey for 45 years and would LOVE to get on my skates again for non-competitive skating.&#160; The fear is twisting the knee so they recommended the Defiance model which keeps the knee in a straight line.&#160; There is probably a model that would lock your knee along one axis to prevent any damage while swimming that stroke.</p><p></p><p>Saw a video of a 20-something&#160;female surfer with her knee in a serious brace.&#160; Looks like her knee injury didn&#39;t keep her from her favorite sport.&#160; So research the bad forces you have to avoid and the call the brace maker to recommend the correct one for that type&#160;of swimming.&#160; Worth a shot...I&#39;m getting mine in the next few months.</p>"

It seems that you are investigating every thing that could help without any answers. I have bad pain behind my knees, however, I have this pain because of bilateral knee replacement. One thing that I did notice was that the pain at the back of my knee was triggered by muscle tightness elsewhere, such as muscle around the ITBand , as well as from sciatica. Perhaps your pain is triggered elsewhere and reflected at the knee. Don't give up in trying to get help to figure this out as pain that is not from an obvious reason is not always easy to figure out.

          "Hi everyone. (Btw I'm new to this forum). For the past several months, I've been dealing with lingering pain in the back of BOTH legs (behind the knee). It started out gradually in my right leg, and a few weeks later, my left leg began to hurt as well. Whenever I extend my legs, I feel this persistent, aching sort of tension in the area. It's mostly fine when I'm sitting or bending my knees, but it hurts a lot when I'm standing (especially in the morning). The pain hasn't been getting significantly worse over time, but certainly isn't showing signs of improvement or recovery either. I first went to an orthopedic doctor who gave me anti-inflammatories, but those had no effect. Eventually, I got an X-Ray and MRI, and he said everything looked normal. After that, I went to a physical therapist, who noticed that I was flat-footed but also couldn't determine anything wrong with the area behind my knees. He gave me some general exercises to do, but none of those would alleviate my pain. Finally, I saw a rheumatologist, who also didn't really discover anything wrong. She mentioned that I might have very mild hyperextension, but wasn't definitive about it and couldn't come up with an actual diagnosis. I've tried various methods of stretching, foam rolling, massage, skin patches, topical creams, etc. ... but none of them have helped. This has really been bothering me over the last few months - not only the consistent pain, but also the fact that I have no idea what this condition is. I'm a high school baseball player at risk of missing the upcoming season since it's extremely hard for me to sprint, move laterally, and pivot my legs. And this whole time, my parents have been blaming me for running up the medical bill. Whenever I complain about it, they always tell me to \"just deal with it\" and stop being \"mentally weak.\" I'd really appreciate any ideas or suggestions in regard to what the problem might be, what other kind of doctor could help, or simply how to relieve the pain. Thanks."

          "my story is a mixed bag so I will apologise before hand. i am a 39 year old female who up until 2 years ago seemed in reasonable health. Then summer 2016 I developed what I thought was an upper respiratory virus which led to head wooziness, brain fog, motion sickness, sense of unbalanced, fatigue and joint aches, tension headaches and neck pain. Unexplained petechia and perpura at different times, my skin is very sensitive and pale gah translucent, an explosion off cherry moles aswell, flare up off rosacea eye cysts and sun intolerance. Numbness in feet and pins and needles in extremities. Doctor thinks that this has all been viral and continues to be her diagnosis. The fatigue i had had been dealing with a couple off years before that had iron fixed, put on vitamin d and had blood tests to rule out other illnesses. Everything came back clear and fatigue continued. i visited ent twice who ruled out anything to do with ears, neurologist who beleives it\u2019s not in the brain but possibly systemic, brain mri came back clear so no MS etc. was then referred to rheumatologist who ruled out autoimmune but said casually I was hypermobile. With hyperextension in my elbows, fingers, knees and ankles, nothing further was mentioned. i still suffer from head wooziness every few weeks, this is not vertigo but rather a spinning sensing within the brain without visual movement. I think hormones, tiredness and iPad glare have a part to play in this, however no one can give me a reason for it, I experience titinus from time to time, the occasional tension headache, brain fog daily and a general feeling off fuzziness within the head daily. My fatigue is still very much relevant as is the fatigue in my legs when I go up stairs and in my arms when I am moving using them for any length of time ie hoovering, using hairdryer. I still experience pins and needles in hands feet, legs etc and numbness in feet, heel and toe pads mainly. I have been suffering from tendinitis in my left Achilles\u2019 tendon with nodules for months the pain now an everyday occurrence, I have pain in both pads of feet and have to wear soft cushion soles or it flares up. Now I realise this pain may be linked to my hyper mobility. I often experience knee pain as if I\u2019ve pulled my ligaments and elbow pain, pain in my pinkies, grinding at the bottom of my spine and muscles spasms in lower back and across my shoulders. Especially if standing for any length of time. I sprained the top of my foot twice, and had inflammation in the cartridge between my ribs and chest bone twice over the past couple of years, I often feel like I sprain the top of my hands a lot recently. I can just drop objects out of my grasp on occasion to, i always had what I thought were week ankles, falling over and going over them all the time, wearing high heals was a no no unless it had a wide heal. To find out that they were weak for a reason. And I have pulled my groin 4 times in the recent weeks moving the wrong way. I have a lot of bruising especially on my arms and legs with minimal trauma, IBS bloating and pain and unexplained xanthelasma under my eyes with no high cholesterol. I also have high pallet and over crowded mouth, and sadly problem with anaesthetics to my dismay. i am very aware none of these could be related n any way but I feel there is something wrong and I\u2019m not sure where else to go medically. Oh and I\u2019ve recently had an MRI of the spine, nothing has shown up in any test, wish I had MRI of cervical spine though as I feel some of my symptoms may be held within that area. Sorry for the book book I guess I\u2019m just clutching at straws. Could some of this be caused of hyper-mobility I just don\u2019t know?. Regards tracky"

          " Your surgery has not failed. If it had, you would not be walking. Lysis is the thickening of the scar tissue. A lot of the time you need to exercise and bend the knee. Don't stress about the degree of bend, that is unimportant. In order to get the bend you have to strengthen the muscles, also like catch 22, if you don't do one the other will suffer and vice versa. Of course it will hurt when you walk, you have had your bone chopped off and a metal joint is in its place, your muscles are under developed and your mending nerves are sending your brain into a tizzy. If you really are worried, see your doctor, he will say the same thing about the operation as will the surgeon, if your scarring is dried and healed use bio oil or any natural oil and massage it into the scarred area, knead it into your skin. There are a lot of things you can be doing, one of them is being positive. One way of bending your knee properly is to walk down stairs slowly, with emphasis on bending as you go down, if you cannot do it, don't give up, walk down backwards again slowly. Being despondent is normal ,but you have to fight it hi suzie. bending isn't too much of an issue, you're right. However, extension is causing me all thr problems. i did not have a tkr. My original surgery was acl. its recovery time is short compared to tkr. my friends have had the surgery and they are back to jogging within 3 to 4 months of having the surgery. my lysis of adhesion was not so successful as the surgeon was still not able to get me to 0 degrees of extension. that's not even counting hyperextension! he considered releasing my posterior calsule, but thought it was not worth it for 5 degrees. As it turns out, 5 degrees matters a lot to me as im unable to walk without pain. unfortunatel, my extension has worsened since the arthrofibrosis surgery. it is now at 10 degrees or maybe even worse. i'm going back in 2 months, which is too long of a wait. i'll try to get in sooner"
