          " I also forgot to mention that when I moved country I was diagnosed with very low Vitamin D levels, which I read can also cause twitching. I've been taking these vitamins since October 2013, but no positive change as of yet... Magnesium is important for maintaining a steady heart rhythm, so possibly you haven\u2019t been taking the right form of it and/or the correct dose. You need the advice of a doctor who is really up on magnesium supplements. Once on the correct magnesium regimen you may find your muscle twitches are reduced, killing two birds with one stone. Having said that, your muscle problems sound a lot like neuropathies. Hasn\u2019t anyone suggested that to you? I have had a neuropathic right thigh muscle for three years now. The first sign of it was a distinct feeling that I\u2019d spilled ice water on my thigh! This morphed into the (again) distinct feeling that a large adhesive bandage was being pulled off the top of my thigh. The latest sensation I have there\u2014all of these sensations being mercifully brief\u2014is a very strong burning sensation. In between I too have had the feeling of muscles moving under the skin of my thigh or ants crawling on it. Because of those two phenomena I thought to mention neuropathy to you in the first place. So you may want to suggest this to your doctor or straightaway see a neurologist. About vitamin D, the dosage is critical. Be sure your doctor is taking into account your blood results, your age, and is also up on the latest guidelines. My doctor has me on drops (I\u2019m 71) and advises I take them once a week since this vitamin is slowly absorbed. Another option, and maybe the best, is to spend 20\u201d a day in the sun.  Would it be worth seeing if you could get a neurologist opinion? Thank you for the suggestions! Back in my home country I did get a prescription for a neurologist, but never got around to make an appointment, thinking that of all things I've ever been sick with, there's no way I'm nerve-damaged. The fact that I moved countries really soon after that doctor visit contributed to turning down that visit too... Turns out I might actually be nerve-damaged, and I regret not going to a neurologist much earlier. My current doctors almost refuse to do anything until I go to the expensive physiotherapist as they prescribed, and no matter how many times I mention it they ask me to calm down and reassure me that they want the best for me and I should not be too hypochondriac about it all. Well I am not... I'm actually really surprised - I always thought there has to be a very serious reason for nerves to become damaged... I got my first twitches in a sunny April afternoon reading news on my laptop, lying on my bed. No recent traumas, no mental shocks, no nothing, I guess that's why I was so quick to dismiss the possibility of nerve problems... Seeing a neurophysio may help as they have a good understanding of nerve conditions. I see one which is Very helpful. I'm so glad things are moving along for you. After my experiences and friends' experiences I say: never let doctors get away with hinting that you are a hypochondriac! If that physiotherapist is so expensive you may want to look at alternative therapies like acupuncture. But don't go that route until you have a diagnosis *you can accept* from a specialist like a neurologist. Speaking of nerve damage, recent research shows that sufferers with fibromyalgia often have damaged peripheral nerves. I'm not suggesting you have fibromyalgia. The point is that this is a new kind of finding, and I don't believe the researches know how the nerves got damaged. So, hang in there and all the best! I have had twitching, burning, sensitivity and muscle pain for nearly 3 years. I have seen a couple of neurologists but they can't find anything wrong. At the moment I take gabapentin and amatriptyline"

          "Hello everyone, it will soon be a year since this problem of mine started and nobody has yet found a solution to it, so I thought I have nothing to lose by asking here. Around April last year I started getting muscle twitches. Out of nowhere. It continued for a month, until I finally went to doctor about it, no fun when your fingers get all jumpy when you sit still, or your muscles twitch so much it wakes you from your sleep. It's pretty unplesant when there's muscles moving under your skin all the time. In the thigh, in the leg, in the finger, in the neck... I think I even had it in the eye once. I so much wish it would just stop. Doctor said it was a lack of magnesium, but a few months later the problem persisted, and a new sensation developed in my left shoulder blade - the warm buzzy \"running ants feeling\". I moved to another country, so went to another doctor there. That doctor stated that my neck is very stiff and asked if I suffer from migraine, which I don't think I do. They said I should try exercising a bit more - it should exhaust the muscles so they don't have the energy to twitch. They also prescribed going to a physiotherapist, which is a pretty expensive procedure to me, so I am still hesitating. In the meantime, the muscle twitching has subsided to a few times a day, however, the \"running ants feeling\" became more frequent. Exercise doesn't seem to alter it that much... Other minor problems I have that might be related to this are heart rhythm problems in the evening and inability to stay in a bent-down position for more than a few minutes (gives me a terrible headache and dizzyness), I also suffer from obsessive thoughts, really often (I mention this since I have heard that psychological health matters a lot when it comes to muscle twitching) If someone could comment on this I would be really grateful. Doctors say they can't do anything about it, but they didn't really think of checking my nerves - maybe there's a pressed nerve, or something?"

          " Hi rose I think most people are left with some aftermath following laser photocoagulation. I was left with a load of floaters. Dont regret getn it done, your other option would have been to risk having a complete retinal detachment and loosing your sight in the eye. I did have the flickering at the side the day the tear happened and I hadnt a clue what it was but as I say I think most people have something goin on after the surgery. Dont hesitate to get a second opinion if it gives you peace of mind, Rose.  <p>Hi Rose,</p><p></p><p>I know this is an old thread, but just wanted to say that I&#39;m experiencing the same exact thing! The opthalmologist told me it&#39;s not unusual because of the laser scarring and that it may decrease over time or not, but regardless it is safe. I totally feel your frustration as I went into this as more of a preventative procedure for a small hole that wasn&#39;t giving me any issues and now I&#39;m still occasionaly seeing that weird spot (almost like a gray/white glimmer) in certain lighting far off in my perpheral vision.</p><p></p><p>I know this is better than the alternative, but it&#39;s so frustrating! Did yours ever decrease? I had my procedure done about 2 weeks ago and it seems slightly smaller (maybe?), but just trying not to obsess over it so much.&#160;</p><p></p><p>Best wishes!!</p> <p>Hello, everyone. I am so glad that I have found this thread! Almost 3 weeks ago, I had laser surgery for a hole in my retina due to lattice degeration. I started off with a few floaters, went to the opthalmologist but he didn&#39;t see anything at that time (that was a Friday), then over the weekend had a few flashes and so I went back in on Tuesday and he found the lattice and referred me to a vitreoretinal specialist. The retinal specialist said that I was at risk for a retinal detachment and ended up doing laser on my left eye that same day. After surgery , I had a miriad of new symptoms, lots of new flashes, some new floaters, at one point it looked like someone was shining a red light on my retina when my eye was closed, small black flashing dots that would come and go, black rain especially when my eye was closed, and lightning strikes. Also, like some of you have described, the day after I noticed 4 black circular &quot;holes&quot; in my vision, and a blurry spot in my peripheral vision by my nose. I went back the next day and she told me that everything was looking ok. I assume it is where she lasered. Currently, I am dealing with the static electricity/flashing in my left eye from about 12 o&#39;clock to 6 o&#39;clock from my perspective which is more noticable in dim light/darkness/when my eye is closed. The static gets worse when I&#39;m in bright light for some time and calms down after I&#39;m in the dark or sleep but comes right back when I&#39;m in light. I also get a flash here and there close to my nose that is noticable in any light, and infrequent small black dot flashes. I&#39;ve also been dealing with terrible dry eye in my left eye, which I think has led to swelling of my eyelid, pain, and twitching of my face around my eye. My eye is slightly light sensitive and blurry which I think is from the dryness. The retina specialist also found lattice in my right eye (less than my left) and is recommending I have it lasered once my left eye is not symptomatic. This has all been so terrifying and I have been an anxious mess since it started. Crying at the drop of a hat. I&#39;m a nurse and worrying about myself while at work is just adding to my stress. But I have to find a way to power on because I have 2 kids (1 and 7 years old) that depend on me. I am only 34 years old and this has thrown me for a loop especially because my vision has always been good, I just need a slight prescription for distance. My fiance says that I shouldn&#39;t worry so much because each time I&#39;ve gone to the doctor since the laser, she&#39;s said that it looks stable (4 times so far in a little over 2 weeks, I&#39;ve gone back for every change worrying that the worst was happening). It&#39;s nice to know that I&#39;m not alone. I am so thankful to have found this thread and know that other people have had similar symptoms since my doctor didn&#39;t explain these things as potential side effects or occurrences and when I go back she says it is stable but it doesn&#39;t feel that way.</p>"

          "I posted on here a few weeks ago about a black/gray spot I kept seeing after the retinal tear laser surgery. I saw on the doctor's notes it was the photocoagulation. I also saw that I have lattice degeneration which I'm assuming contributed to the tear. I am not seeing the black spot so much anymore, unless I blink or change rooms with different lightings, but now in its place I am constantly seeing a flashing light that looks white especially in dim lighting. It extends to the side of my eye as well, which I'm assuming is from where the laser was also done. I went to the retinal specialist and said everything looked fine and this could be a side effect of the laser and it generally goes away within a couple months. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this with the laser and if it went away? this has been very disorienting for me and I have been fearing losing my peripheral vision. I'm not sure if I am actually losing peripheral vision or if it just feels that way since I have this constant flickering now on the side. I know it's better to be safe than sorry, but a part of me wishes I never did this laser bc its been causing so many issues for me and supposedly the tear had scar tissue from healing itself. If anyone has had any experience with this and would like to share I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you."

          " Hi linda, it took 7yrs for someone to notice my chiari malformation, and it was a spinal specialist in a Newcastle hospital who sent me for mri on spine, and did head too incase problem came from my neck. He picked up on it and sent me to neurosurgeon. I have seen number of neurologists over the yrs but I was lucky to get this consultant. My sister has ms and it took 2yr for her to be diagnosed too. I do hope you get someone in Scotland to sort you out.

Unless they cancel it again. I know it's not fair to have to pay to get the help, but I was messed around by a clueless neurologist who basically told me that I was imagining it all! Having said that, I was told that I needed, and put on the list for surgery in May and have waited all this time, getting more and more ill. Good luck and I'm more than happy to help in anyway I can. Clare x Thank you Linda and Helen for your kind wishes! I'm dreading the surgery, but I'm dreading them cancelling it again even more! I'm in Glasgow. I found Mr Taylor through getting recommendations from my GP staff and then just phoning around hospitals asking who was the best ' chiari man'!"

          "Hi. I've had \"incidental\" finding on MRI after 3 yrs of hell re symptoms post severe bicycle accident. Really flared this summer after another bike writeoff after dooring accident. All sx I've had before MRI match Chiari, GP dismisses me despite MRI, Physio dismisses me, neurology said I've no sx as GP, Physio & each specialist can't communicate in our modern world of technology. I'm now back to snakes & ladders game again. Does anyone live in Edinburgh Scotland and know where to get a human in the NHS who can look at all my sx and deals with Chiari. I've tried numerous times leaving messages on voicemail with Ann Conway trust but no answer. If there's a GP/Neurology person out there in cyberspace I would appreciate someone who can advice how/where/what to do. My worst sx are the manic sensitivity to sound/choking when bad that starts as difficulty breathing/jellyfish in head moving feeling which is nauseating/unable to lie down for neck pain/deep diving pressure in head/constant flicking eye/really loud thunder in ear/leg that is so weak it gives way/freezing freezing hands feet bum nose/mental cracking grinding \"rice crispy\" noise in neck with extreme pain/the ice cream cone twisted feeling in my head that stops me being able to turn my neck to look over my shoulder/excruciating pain over L1/2 ....sorry said I'd say the worst but this is just a tad. I'm alone so the choking is the worrying one/it also slows heart right down - pulses to 30 just before I end up on floor almost blacking out. Oh, add peeing in pants just to make life more fun. My GP tells me that none of it could be related - asked if she know condition or has treated someone & get \"I'm a general GP\". Sad, 3 years telling dead folk what's wrong - get an answer and they even more deaf. Please help. I'm delinquent at technology so no sure how this all works so a 2 year old guide in how to see if there's an answer would help. Almost had a meltdown figuring out a password. Bad day - eyes flicking, thunder in ear, legs twitching, backs spamming & neck grinding. Oh vey"

          " I have only just had my second surgery (5 weeks ago) so can't say I've had the same thing happen... My consultant has said that they cannot grow back, (he is a specialist in this condition) but that scar tissue can form... Though I am not so sure. Where did you have the surgery? My local consultant had never done the surgery either, so he reffered me to a specialist that had! He didn't try and undertake a difficult operation without knowing what he was doing. I've read lots since my surgery, the one thing that I have read over and over is to make sure the surgeon is experienced. Otherwise there is a high risk of nerve damage... It is a tricky surgery. Good luck with the tests, I hope you can get this sorted. Take care  Many thanks for your reply :) I had the surgery done in Northampton...my main consultant's speciality is fractures and I also had another consultant present who is a spinal specialist. They did warn me about the nerve damage and all other risks. I just can't understand why i was pain free for almost a year and now suddenly i have it all back again. I'm being sent for another MRI scan aswell and have an appointment with my consultant again on April 5th to discuss the results. Wishing you a speedy recovery :) I have read that recovery from the surgery is a very long one, more like multiple years rather than months... But heck there is so much contradictory information on the internet it is hard to know who to believe. I hope you don't have to go through the surgery again, it is awful. Waiting so long for appointments doesn't help either. You are left worrying for ages!! Thanks :) Yep, i know what you mean... some consultants on here say that they can't grow back when others say they can. Grrr i don't know. Will find out in April whats going on i guess!! Thank-you :) well I will keep an eye out to see how you get on :) not a reply just a problem i had 2 cervical ribs one on each side , had right one removed no problem left one rib removed but had to leave knuckle end in as it is attached to my spine and lots of nervesw rapped round it .had no problem for roughly 6 years now lots of pain in sholder and hand going numb and neck pain and head pain , also had top rib removed to give room in case it started again , wich i think it has ,i also think i may have severe nerve pain due to this , the trouble is when they said they had to leave the knuckle end in, as it was attached to spine they said if it reocours they may b able to take it out from the back ,but surely if its attached to spine is this dangerous, . Hello Gloriana mine too was attached to my spine :s... I went back to see my consultant on thursday for my results and i'm still fuming now!! He told me that the results of my nerve and muscle tests show that i have improved slightly. then he went on to say that he is 99% sure that i will end up having to have another operation, but is going to send me for more physio (which never helped last time, just made the pain worse!!) and then i will have more nerve and muscle tests in a years time!!! Great... so got to be in agony for another year!!!!!!! Hello Gloriana mine too was attached to my spine :s... I went back to see my consultant on thursday for my results and i'm still fuming now!!

Great... so got to be in agony for another year!!!!!!! do u get nerve pain in arm and sholder n back and pins n needles .and does the pain ever go up to head and neck.and do u think with it attached to spine it might b dangerous to take out, hello, i am 20 years old girl and i am having cervical rib on my right side....till now no major problem has occured but I expect such pains to happen in future can any one please suggest me what should I do? I mean please suggest me some excercises or anything that can help. I was also thinking to go for some operation but I can see that it can also have drawbacks, this time my life is going good and I just feel very slight pain in my shoulder sometimes and not very often. I will be very grateful to anyone who can help me with their suggestions to help me reduce any future problem regarding this....please friends suggest me some exercises or anything that can help. thanks. dear alka i had a cervical rib removed from my right side about 10 yrs ago and i have never had any trouble from that one at all since and all went very well . so u never know ,keep posative because u cant worry about wat may happen because it may not ,i have only had trouble with my left one because it is attatched to my spine. hope all goes well with it for u , hi there, i cant believe i came accross this as i had thrasioc outlet syndrome 8 years ago, there fore i had both top first ribs removed on both sides (they were not extra ones as some women have) and it was painful.i still get serve pain in my right shoulder blade due to muscle being removed also hand numbness which is permanant !!!!! my advise to anyone is really search and search to find a natural way off healing this.Also serve finger clawing which i still have all these years later!!! Good luck thanks for your suggestions friends isn't there any natural way of healing this(cervical rib), so that the growth of this extra rib can be controlled.... help someone.... thanks. i dont see how u could stop wat is a bone from growing or any way of healing one really  hello gloriana, thanks for your reply i want to ask you something did you go through operation because your cervical rib became troubling, or you got operated to come on the safer side?? was the situation really bad?? please reply"

          "I had the cervical rib removed in July 2009 (I only had one on my left side)... i had all the usual symptoms, muscle wastage, twitching, aching, cramps, pins and needles. It took almost a year after my operation to finally feel normal-ish again. But for the last 9 months all of the symptoms have come back... but they are worse than they have ever been before. The twitching in my fingers and thumb wake me up in the middle of the night... and the shooting pains and aches bring tears to my eyes. I went to see my consultant last week, who examined me and is sending me for more nerve and muscle tests on March 5th. Ever since he examined me i have been in absolute agony!!! My husband is scared to massage me incase he makes it worse, but i dont know what to do with myself. Has anyone else had the same experience? My consultant didn't really go into why he thought i was in so much pain... just that he wanted me to have the tests done asap. I just hope i don't have to have another operation :( although i just want the pain to go away. Bit of a bummer with timing though as i've been trying to find a new job!! Does anyone think it's possible for the 'rib' to form again? Or is it most likely to be the scar tissue causing me all this grief? Thinking back... i don't think my consultant had performed this operation before and i was also part of the training/course for new doctors!! I have a funny feeling that they didn't remove it all. Many thanks :)"

          " <p>Best wishes to you Myra. &#160;Definitely can relate to your experiences. &#160;I would hope for you that at your age and personal health that your recovery will be speedy. &#160;I had it in 1992 on the right side of my face. &#160;I was in good health and think it took around 6 weeks. &#160;I did facial exercises (exerated smile) as often as I could think of it. &#160;I believe that helped. &#160;</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, I have it for a second time on the left side of my face. &#160;Recovery is going slow. &#160;I have many complicated health issues now and of course am older. &#160;I&#39;ve had it for 15 weeks now. &#160;Just this week my face looks less lopsided to me when I look in the mirror. &#160;I suspect my health issues contribute to my slow recovery. &#160;My primary told me that I could expect up to 6 months, and possibly a chronic condition of it. &#160;That is why I&#39;m encouraged by the bits of improvement this week.</p><p></p><p>I think you should be encouraged by the sensations you described. &#160;I&#39;d suggest your exercising your face by attempting to smile. &#160;It helped me &#160;before and am trying my best to achieve it now.</p><p></p><p>Best wishes to you for a speedy recovery.</p> <p>Day 3 of Bells. </p><p></p><p>I woke up with a more watery right eye. </p><p></p><p>I am able to close my right eye a bit more...praise Jesus and am able to start chewing on my right side. Drinking from a mug has become easier too. </p><p></p><p>I still can&#39;t smile or pucker my lips using my right side of the face but I am bey happy with being able to close my right eye a bit more! </p><p></p><p>Have a doctors appointment on Friday so will see what the doctor says. </p><p></p><p>I am a marathoner and a bit nervous to start running in the cold. Any suggestions on exercising? I am wearing glasses for the time being until my eye can blink again and I can put contacts in so I think my glasses will help keep the dust particles out of my right eye. </p><p></p><p>No twitching or spasms today. </p><p></p><p>I got flower delivered from one of my best friends. Made me day! </p><p></p><p>Only positive vibes! </p><p></p> Day 4 with Bells. Late last night my nose started twitching. Throughout the day my right side has been having pins and needles as well as some twitching in various areas. Later tonight I realized I can move my tongue from my left side of my mouth to my right side and stick my tongue out pretty straight out. I can also move my jaw!!!! My like I can shut my right eye a bit more today. Finished all my exams and just destressing from here on out. Might be a Christmas miracle to have some sort of smile! Positive thoughts and prayers!!!  <p>Day 5 with Bells. </p><p></p><p>This morning I thought I would wake up with more ability to move my face but unfortunately that was not the case. </p><p></p><p>I continue to get twitching around my mouth, eye and right check area. </p><p></p><p>Still unable to blink, raise my right eyebrow or smile. </p><p></p><p>Went out in public today and find it was difficult to communicate. Kinda feels like talking with a fat lip. </p><p></p><p>My eye seems to get more blurry and my vision gets distorted more outside and out in public. </p><p></p><p>Today just wasn&#39;t the best day. </p><p></p><p>It has only been day 5 and I am already struggling with keeping a positive and open mind set. </p><p></p><p></p> <p>Day 6 with Bells. </p><p></p><p>I feel very exhausted today. I couldn&#39;t get as much done as I hoped and planned. </p><p></p><p>I beleive my eye does shut more but I am not sure. </p><p></p><p>Still unable to move my eyebrow and smile. </p><p></p><p>I seem to have a headache and pressure around my right eye. </p><p></p><p>Seeing the doctor tomorrow. </p><p></p><p>Getting frustrated with trying to eat using my right side. </p> <p>Day 11 with Bells. </p><p></p><p>I haven&#39;t written much this there hasn&#39;t been any major improvement. </p><p></p><p>I no longer feel any tinglyness around the right side of the face. A couple of days ago my right side left very sore. </p><p></p><p>Today I can shut my eye 85% of the way. My right ear is in a lot of pain. </p><p></p><p>I am VERY tired of wearing my glasses. I tried to wear contacts for a bit yesterday but without blinking naturally the contact got dried out. </p><p></p><p>Any suggestions? </p> No suggestions re: wearing contact lenses. I found it helpful getting a washcloth wet and in a ziplock bag and microwave to warm. Warm compress was soothing for the ear pain you described. Someone suggested using alternating warm and cold to me. Best wishes. <p>I am on week 3 and I understand how you feel. I hate this at Christmas time and going out in public. &#160;<img src=\"http://s8.patient.media/forums/emoticons/sad.gif\" alt=\"sad\" />&#160;</p> Wondering if the recovery with Bells Palsy is gradual or you just wake up being able to smile and raise your eyebrow?  <p>Day 12. </p><p></p><p>Feeling depressed that I haven&#39;t seen any signs of recovery. </p><p></p><p>I feel very exausted in the middle afternoon. I feel like my vision is starting to get more blurry. </p><p></p><p>Hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. </p> <p>Day 15. Merry Christmas Eve!!! </p><p></p><p>No change yet. Can&#39;t move my eyebrow, make a full smile or close my eye fully. </p><p></p><p>This waiting game truly sucks. </p><p></p><p>Nervous to be out with people tonight. Doesn&#39;t seem like I will be taking any pictures tonight. </p> Hi Myra Sorry to hear about your Bells Palsy. My Wife 70 years old started with this about 4 weeks ago. Not a lot of improvement yet, Jaw ache, ear ache not quite as bad. The worst thing is this persistant irrittated eye, Joan says it feels like she has got a bit of grot in her in her eye. Tried all sorts of Drops (from Doctor). The only thing that seems to work at the moment is to keep the eye covered at all times. Just come to this conclusion over the last couple of days. Does anyone with Bells Palsy have eye irratation most of the time and how do they cope with it?. Brian"

          " <p>Hi rach985 the perceived wisdom in other countries such as Japan and the U.S is to treat Vitamin B12 Deficiency under 500 so your readings definitely fall into a &quot;grey area&quot; as highlighted below&#160;under the heading &quot;<em>Types of tests for B12 Deficiency</em>&quot; talking about the Serum Vitamin B12 Test American professionals say:-</p><p></p><p>&quot;<em>However, it appears that these markers demonstrate B12 deficiency primarily in patients whose serum B12 is in the &quot;[b]gray zone[/b]&quot; (a serum B12 result between [b]200 pg/ml and 450 pg/m[/b]l). &#160;We believe that the &quot;[b]norma[/b]l&quot; B12 threshold needs to be raised from 200 pg/ml to at least 450 pg/ml because deficiencies begin to appear in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) below 550 pg/ml</p><p></p><p>At this time, we believe [b]normal serum B12 levels should be greater than 550 pg/ml. [/b]For brain and nervous system health and prevention of disease in older adults, serum B12 levels should be maintained near or above 1,000 pg/ml</em>.&quot;</p><p></p><p>Anyone at any age, can become B12 deficient. However, certain people are at an elevated risk. They include the following:</p><p></p><p><em>Vegetarians, vegans and people eating macrobiotic diets.</p><p>People aged sixty and over</p><p>People who\u2019ve undergone any gastric and/or intestinal surgery, including bariatric surgery for weight loss purposes (Gastric bypass).</p><p>People who regularly use proton-pump- inhibitors. H2 blockers, antacids, Metformin, and related diabetes drugs, or other medications that can interfere with B12 absorption.</p><p>People who undergo surgeries or dental procedures involving nitrous oxide, or who use the drug recreationally.</p><p>People with a history of eating disorders (anorexia or bulimia).</p><p>People with a history of alcoholism.</p><p>People with a family history of pernicious anaemia.</p><p>People diagnosed with anaemia (including iron deficiency anaemia, sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia).</p><p>People with Crohn\u2019s disease, irritable bowel syndrome, gluten enteropathy (celiac disease), or any other disease that cause malabsorption of nutrients.</p><p>People with autoimmune disorders (especially thyroid disorders such as Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis and Grave\u2019s disease) Type 1 diabetes, vitiligo, lupus, Addison\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, infertility, acquired agammaglobulinemia, or a family history of these disorders.</p><p>Women with a history of infertility or multiple miscarriages</em>.&#160;Do you see yourself in any of the above people? &#160;If you do make a list of &#160;the &quot;possible causes&quot; together with your symptoms and present it to your doctor and ask him to treat you in accordance with the BNF Guidelines - a copy of which he should have on his desk as follows:-</p><p></p><p>[b]Treatment of cobalamin deficiency[/b]</p><p>&quot;<em>Current clinical practice within the U.K is to treat cobalamin deficiency with hydroxocobalamin in the intramuscular form outlined in the British National Formulary, BNF,&#160;</p><p></p><p>Standard initial therapy for patients without neurological involvement is 1000 \u00b5g intramuscularly (i.m.) three times a week for two weeks, then every three months.&#160;</p><p></p><p>The BNF advises that for Pernicious anaemia and other macrocytic anaemias patients presenting with neurological symptoms should receive 1000 \u00b5g i.m. on alternative days until there is no further improvement, then 1 mg every 2 months.</p><p></p><p>However, the GWG recommends a pragmatic approach in patients with neurological symptoms by reviewing the need for continuation of alternative day therapy after three weeks of treatment&quot;</em></p><p></p><p>Your doctor should be treating you, the patient, according to your neurological symptoms and not just looking at the computer screen and reading &quot;[b]Normal[/b]&quot; &#160;Test ranges are based on the &quot;average&quot; person and we are not all average.</p><p></p><p>I am not a medically trained person but one who has had Pernicious Anaemia for 45 years and I&#39;m still &quot;<em>clivealive</em>&quot; at 75.</p><p>&#160;&#160;</p> <p>I think that you are deficient in B12. My doctor started me on injections when my level was 176, that was over two years ago now. Like you, I felt utterly exhausted, I was getting numbness in my feet and legs, eye twitches. My balance was off, and I&#39;d stumble into the door frame when going to the bathroom at night. I was also struggling with mental confusion, finding the right words for things.</p><p>As Clive says, the doctor should be treating you by symptoms, not just the level shown in the blood test. Your GP may not be aware that only a small percentage of the B12 in your blood will actually get to the cells that need it! I think it&#39;s 20%! So that makes your level of 167 look very small indeed.</p><p>Have you looked at the Pernicious Anaemia Society website? There is more information on there regarding symptoms, and there are many reasons for low B12, not just PA.</p><p>it might be an idea to ask your GP to test your thyroid function too, as underactive thyroid can cause similar symptoms, and the two often go hand in hand.

          " Also just to mention another symptom I always get is halos (sometimes a double or triple halo) around lights. See the 'major pressure' image to give you an idea. http://www.amandamackay.com/handmade-blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Pigment-dispersion-syndrome.jpg Ask for a referal to a neurologist - your GP does not have a right to refuse. Yes the aura can just be visual and in one eye only. The eye check would more than likely have picked up any sign of a brain tumour as the aura, in your case, is in the eye Time wise have you tried having your glasses tinted as light can trigger migraines Firstly any onset of Migraine is a Frightening Experience so dont feel like a Hypocondriac you will find on here you are not alone .. I have had Migraines most of my Adult life and still to this day on a occassion think my god what the hell is going on .... Along side which i have my other partner in crime Deppression Again a adult life time whom i live with quote not suffer with ... Each i think is linked to each other my opinion not a medical opinion , for you see it is the brain we are talking about here the most complex part but yet feared part of out anatomy . I can and will offer your support and a sense of humour . It may take some time to find your trigger but dont give up we are remember all individuals so what may well be great for one not so for another .. As with myself and my Happy Tabs as i refer to ... Now theres are few smiler tales i could tell if your ever feeling down . Kindest wishes always xx Thanks for all the replies so far. Is there anybody that experiences these migraines that can offer any advice?  Hi all, Just an update. The frequency has now increased to practically daily migraines. I've seen a neurologist privately and had another eye check up. Eyes perfectly fine, pressure in both eyes is fine. Neurologist examined me and have had an MRI scan. It came back completely normal. I'm at a loss as to what to do next. I have an appointment next week to discuss therapy/meds moving forward. Even if I don't drink alcohol/caffeine etc they still are coming on almost daily. Over half of my day every day is spent with one of my eyes patched and battling a headache. I'm considering getting a private neck xray/scan to rule out anything tension/posture related.  Hey! I've had migraine auras since the age of 11 (now 23) They were prety standard auras then pain (often no pain. migraleve help too) I've suffered with health anxiety over the past 12 years. It became extreme around 2010/11 and i started getting (What seems to be) Retinal Migraines. They began when i had derealization and i beleive stress has caused mine. They happen about 4 times a year (I know not as much as yours) And last 1-2 mins. I've never been diagnosed with any migraines - But with a family history we kinda knew what was happening at age 11. My retinal migraines consist of light, stars and sparkles. They are in one eye (unlike the 2 eye's auras - which i get a couple a month on average..give or take) It seems you've made all the right moves in getting help .You'll notice that over time migraines can increase and decrease and often for no reason. I've gone through bad and good spells. I've read horror stories online about Retinal migrianes (because that's me!!) But you need to know that more often than not they don't cause any severe problems. \"Although frightening, ocular migraines are typically harmless. Most people recover fully. They can sometimes cause damage to the retina and its blood vessels. Permanent vision loss is quite rare.\" So yes, they can cause damage. But it's rare. And with you having a good neuro/doc/eye doc i'm sure they'd be able to monitor it. Which is great. My eyes are fine after 3 years of retinal migraines. But they are a worry! Because I'm natrually prone to worry over my health. It makes me wonder, with your worries, if anxiety could be a rooy cause? Just to add an update to this thread. I am still experiencing these one-sided vision problems practically every day. I have noticed a few things, and done some experiments over the last month or so. 1) If I take painkillers (ibruprofen, paracetamol) it removes some of the headache pain but the vision problems persist. 2) The right eye affected is hard to the touch, and feels like the cornea has enlarged. More rarely there is very mild pain in the eyeball itself. 3) The only thing that seems to provide relief is if I go to sleep. If I sleep for 2-3 hours, usually the symptoms don't return until the next day. 4) I have noticed on days that I exercise intensely I get a longer period without the symptoms coming back. 5) I have cut out alcohol/caffeine and no difference. Also avoided computer use and no difference. One other biggie to mention, is I have depression and anxiety. However on days when I go out (say a night out) when there is no real stress that day, these vision issues still happen. I am now wondering if this is blood pressure related, or perhaps a sign of glaucoma or maybe some sort of sinus/eye infection? I am considering getting an appointment with an opthamologist to thouroughly examine the eye before and during an attack so see if any differences can be measured. As I understand it a migraine is largely neurological, so if I do experience pressure increases in an eye or swelling, I wouldn't actually associate that with migraine. Also as mentioned before I will also look into a good head/neck x-ray. Unfortunately for the depression side I am being offered SSRI's but I feel to see how these will magic away these very physical problems.   So sorry to hear you have these symptoms. It is very scary to have this happen. I do not blame you for not wanting to take the SSRI's. Have you looked into Holistic treatment for your issues? There are a lot of good Drs who think outside the box and offer alternative Meds and such. Maybe that would help you? Good luck. Hi Paul, I was just browsing the internet about having the same kind of headache you have, and found that I have the same kind of problems of headaches. It started with me about 4 years ago, (I had depressesion, therefore I laid in my bed for days on an end.) It started in that period. (I would also like to say that I have always been on the computer for hours each day) Back than I had it every week, and It only happend on the right side of my head. I felt my heartbeat at the right side of my head, and I had tears coming out of my right eye (even though I was not crying. I also head visual problems when I had the headache. Only at the right side.) Anyway, after a couple of month the future looked better, I didn't stay the whole day in bed anymore. But the headache kept getting worse. I used to take a dafalgan, which made it better in about 30 minutes.) After a while the headache went away, I had only a couple of times a month, but it wasn't as severe as it used to be. Now for a year, I have it mostly everyday. It mostly starts when I get out of bed, that I feel a headache is coming. I can feel a very little pulse in the right side of my head, and It gets worse by the minute. It also comes back mostly in the evening, and I havnt found anything that can actually \"cure\" it. As I don't want to take pills everytime I have this headache, which is basicaly daily. However, I havnt' found anything wrong with my neck, or any kind of pains with it. If you have found something that have helped you, please share. kind regards Hi all. I finally have found a diagnosis to my problem. I have been diagnosed with glaucoma/high interocular pressure in the right eye. I have been given drops to use and am possibly having laser surgery soon. Pretty much since day one of taking the drops the headaches have practically disappeared, and visual symptoms are at least 80-90% better than before. I would URGE anybody reading this thread with these symptoms to get a detailed eye pressure check-up (they actually put drops in the eye to numb it and then touch the surface of the eye with a pressure reading device). You may (like me) have to ignore several opinions from high street opticians and neurologists to get to the bottom of it. I wish you all the best. Paul Paul, I started having migraines at 13 and also suffered anxiety and I have only now 30 years later linked the two. I believe people who suffer anxiety with no psychological explanation either produce excess adrenaline or can't break it down. My triggers are exercise (but not every time) and eating oranges which made my tongue swell. Both these involve the release of adrenaline. I see a migraine as a symptom of anxiety. Control the adrenaline with medication and say goodbye to anxiety and migraines. Won't be the case for everyone but worth trying. I am on Propranolol which is for anxiety and also prescribed to prevent migraine. People who get migraine are 3 x more likely to get anxiety. Hope this solves it for you! I'm going through the same thing. What happened with you? Laurie"

          "Hi all, I'm a bit of a newcomer to migraines but will give a breif outline. I have never really suffered from headaches during my life until now (i'm 29). There is no family history of migraines. Out of the blue, after a family function 2 years ago, we got home and I noticed the image out of my right eye was 'cloudy'. I wear glasses so immediately thought my glasses were dirty. I got a shock when taking them off to find it was my eye! I was a bit concerned, then 30mins later I had the worst headache in my life. I had to go to bed early. At some points even the sounds of the TV from downstairs were making me feel sick. It was as if every sound and sense in my body had been amplified. I think there might have been a tiny bit of twitching but can't confirm now as memory of it is a little hazy. I woke up the next day feeling normal again, and put it down to hangover or just a 'bad headache'. I went back to my daily job (work in IT) and didn't think anything of it. The same thing happened again about a month later, this time not a headache as much, more visual symptoms. After 3-4 hours it passed and I was back to normal again. The frequency of them started changing from one every month, then around Jan 2013 one every two weeks, and since around June 2013 one every 7-10 days. At this moment in time I am off work due to depression/anxiety (Since Feb 2014) and currently can get them every 2-4 days. Last week I had four in the space of 7 days. What I experience now: The 'trigger' feeling that I know one is coming is slightly worrying; I can visibly see my pulse (vein shape) pulsing in my right eye's vision to my heartbeat. This goes on for about 15/30mins, then I start to get spots/lines/an 'arc' shape which will sometimes be there and sometimes now. I will also get moments of no vision in that eye 'black spots appearing over the central vision'. When I read of people with 'ocular' migraines they note these symptoms usually leave after approx 1 hour followed by a blinding headache. My concern is the aura stays with me the entire course of the migraine - approx 6-9 hours. I believe I have 'retinal' migraines. Difference being I ONLY get the aura in my right eye. If I patch the right eye my vision is normal out of my left for the entire 9 hours. Also my head feels incredibly tight and sometimes will get a throbbing pain just above the tear duct on the right side of my noise. I have had my eyes checked and been told the pressure is fine (no risk of glaucoma). Also my blood pressure is normal/high (bearing in mind I do suffer with anxiety/depression). I am at my wits end trying to work out what triggers them. I have spent months cutting out caffeine/alcohol. It made no difference. I have also tried limiting my use on computers/phones whilst I am off work. No difference. The only relief I have found is through exercise. I typically don't do any sort of intense daily exercise, maybe a 20min walk a day and household chores. 2 Weeks ago, I decided to start an exercise regimen. Did jogging/walking for about 45mins-1hr each day. I went approx 10 days without a migraine (usually it's every 2-3 days at the moment). I am wondering what in the exercise is causing this relief? Could it be hormonal or just a stress reliever? I don't smoke and don't drink much alcohol any more. I do have a bit of a weak neck - maybe this has something to do with it? My main concern above all else is it's not your typical aura, I only get it in one eye. I have also noted that I have never had a migraine before 1PM and after 10PM (apart from one rare occasion at 4AM when I was having a panic attack in bed). Something is happening between approx 2PM-10PM to trigger it, but I don't know what. I'm a bit of a hyperchondriac at the moment, thinking it's a brain tumour or i'm at risk of stroke. I wanted to get a scan but GP said \"if you would have had a brain tumour since 2012 you would know by now\" and suggested meds. Does anybody else here suffer from there 'retinal' migraines, or can offer any support or advice? Any replies would mean so much to me. Thank you :)."
