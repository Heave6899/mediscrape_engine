          " I think you should make an appointment with a good chiropractor. Preferably one who specializes in spinal decompression.  Hey vikki, I'm also 28 with severe pain..your situation is EXACTLY like mine.. Everything down to the lumbar puncture.. I was medevac out of iraq and the military doctors diagnosed me with thunderclap migraines... Along with the head neck and back pain I have severe knee pain... Unfortunately I became addicted to the medication the doctors prescribed me... So now pain medications are out of the question because I have since gone to rehab.. I have recently gone to a chiropractor who said I am in desperate need of help so I will be returning to him shortly..I have a question, have you ever been checked for Lyme disease? Hi Vicki I am in a similar situation but have been like this for over 30 years now. I am on similar meds and had some nerve blocks in my cervical spine last year to no avail. I've has an MRI of my cervical spine but not one lower down. I have sciatica and several sore spots along my spine, and wonder if it could be a disc problem. How have you got on since posting? This is my first time writing in a forum as well. I am in dire need if an explanation. In March of this year I just experiencing a dulling feeling in the back of my head and in my neck..out of nowhere. It was so bad I had to fly home from vacation. I went straight to the ER where I was pumped with pain meds and told it was a tension headache and to go home and see my neurologist. 2 ER visits later still the same thing. My CT scan came back normal..Also I went to see a chiropractor no help, orthopedic received a MRI of my spine that was normal and therapy. I am so frustrated that nothing has helped. It doesn't help to have nervous breakdowns either when the pain won't go away. On top of that a new symptom is jaw pain , went to the dentist nothing wrong..However today I am going to pick up a retainer that they say may help me if I am holding my mouth to tight in my sleep. I just don't understand why it has been 5 months and no change. My worst fear is that I have a brain tumor. I am terrified of that. My next neurological appointment is on Monday and I will be demanding a MRI of my brain...If that comes back clear which I pray it does ..I'm afraid this is something I will have to live with everyday for the rest of my life.  Hello everyone, I have also suffered from daily headaches and this is my second year. I have done tests whether it was ct or mri scans, everything looked normal they said. I am still looking for a solution, i surely do not want to live my life like this. I wanted to ask what other symptoms do you suffer? For example I have pressure feeling behind my eyes nose and face, band like headache, sore spots on my scalp, neck and back pain. No medication have helped reduce this pain. However , i have recently read about doctors using endomethacin to solve certain types of daily chronic headaches called Hemicrania continua, do read about it. Unfortunately this medication didn't work for me but i hope it might work for some of you. If you could please answer my question and i hope you keep me updated. Good luck to all of us :)  Hello I am 26 and I'm having the same problem except the back problem... its the back of my neck thst hurts...during my headaches I have hypertension(blood pressure become a lil elevated) but I believe I have hypertension bc of the painful head ached.. I was healthy few months ago working out living normal now I'm miserable everyday....my headaches is trigger but perfum, light,sound, any smoking around me, or anger... I'm going Thur the doctors and every pill I've been giving isn't working... so yesterday a lady told me to elevate my legs w a pillow. Now my legs hv never swell hell I'm only 26... today in months my head stop hurting.... woke up for the first time w no headache although I feel like if I over work my self or turn my head to quick there is a chance my headache will come back..but I'm on my way to sleep now and I feel my head ache coming back because im writing this on my phone with the lights out... i feel like its something to do w circulation in my head. I pray its not a tumor... I'm n the process of getting my head checked..."

          "I am a 28 year old female and I'm currently in my 20th month of chronic headaches. I am now on amitryptline, naproxen and paracetamol as I am now experiencing neck and back pain too. I never write on forums, but feel that if their is the slightest chance that anyone else is suffering like me then i'd love some words of advice or comfort. I feel that unless you deal with chronic pain, you really have no idea how hard it is to deal with and how difficult it is to speak to people about it, as nobody understands. The pain first first came on suddenly during intercourse and it felt like I'd been hit on the back of the head- it was excruciating. I was then left with occasional headaches. After a few months, I was admitted to A and E as the dr suspected a haemorrhage as the head pain started to worsen when straining for the toilet. I was in hospital and had CT, MRI and a lumbar puncture and all sinister problems were ruled out . Since then (19months) the head pain has increased to being constant- as in from the moment I wake till the moment I sleep, everyday. The drs have thrown the medication at me and labelled it as chronic daily headaches and their answer was always more drugs and that it is probably dietry or stress(as I am a teacher)! I then tried everything I could to relieve the pain/find the cause. I have had lots of massage types (including deep tissue), seen the usual dentist and optician, bought a new mattress, new shoes, seen a podiatrist, bought a water pillow(great for neck ache look for mediflow on amazon) acupuncture , I have omitted all food groups from my diet (see candida diet) even reflexology!... no luck, just a poorer and more destroyed version of me. Last week after having a nervous breakdown in the neurologists office and it seems for the first time i am being taken seriously. I think that if you're like me and you dont make a massive fuss, you dont cry lots and you just deal with it as best you can, then they will ignore you. TIP: When you see someone, explain your pain like it is your worst day, not the feeling right then and there and make a list of what you want from your appointment. I had an urgent MRi scan of my cervical spine last week as the neurologist now wants to rule out a slipped disc. I kind of hope that it is, because at at least I will finally have answer (hopefully this week) I don't know what I expect to come from writing here, other than for others to know that they are not alone. Constant pain is truly soul destroying. I now feel only the shadow of my former self. It's hard for others to understand and as a result you drift away from life. I am lucky to have a partner who is completely positive and supportive everyday. Surprisingly though, I have found that one of the best things for me is distraction and the 30 5-6 year olds at work are actually the best thing for me- can you believe it! Thanks for reading. If anyone has any advice, I am all ears!"

This seems to be one of the symptoms of anxiety.</p><p></p><p>When most of us get on anti anxiety meds (even if only for a while) we begin to get some relief and get calm enough to find ways we can help ourselves deal with this. That&#39;s how I found this forum. Lots of help and good advice here, girl.&#160; Hugs, Sally</p> Yes. Not necessarily in the same location either. i know other people who have the same sensations with no anxiety issues. I think its just sime strange body thing. I ignore and wait for it to just go away to be honest. It is strange though. Im on ne meds so its not a side effect either. <p>I haven&#39;t had the vibration symptoms, but have seen others post about it. However, I do get the hot/cold hands and feet, also some numbness and tingling. Many times it feels like the tip of my tongue has been burned, and will sometimes last for days. </p><p>It&#39;s a shame that your doctor won&#39;t refer you, and you&#39;re stuck paying out of pocket for all of the expensive tests.</p><p>Everyone would like to avoid taking medication for anxiety, but sometimes that does more harm than good. Medication isn&#39;t a life sentence, but it&#39;s a tool that can be used to help get you over this rough patch. I hope you find some help very soon, and the symptoms go away.</p> <p>Since you&#39;ve not said anything about feeling anxious,or over whelmed, I guess it&#39;s not anxiety. When you have anxiety,you feel that and everything else times 10. Hopefully since nothing was found so far with the tests you&#39;ve had, maybe it will pass. I&#39;m 57 and everyday,there is a new ache or pain. I can imagine what you are going through,it&#39;s disconcerting. Oh life,always something going on with our bodies. I hope this goes away for you.&#160;</p> Sally I have neuropathy and oh boy it causes just what you mentioned I have to work. would love to talk more when i had ear balance and inner ear. I also had these .the ground vibrated. is it a nerve in the body quivering? wanted to ask that. will read again later. hang in there."

          "<p>I&#39;ve found several forums where there have been posts from people experiencing this disconcerting feeling of an internal quivering or vibration but none of them are current, so I wanted to see if anyone else out there is having the same experience and can share an insight into what might be causing it.</p><p></p><p>I started to get this feeling of internal vibration when I was mainly lying in bed and then occasionally if I shifted position it might last for 30 seconds or so before disappearing. That was about 8 months ago. Now I feel it every night and during the day as well quite often. The other day after a short walk of a few hundred yards followed by a period of standing still it felt like the ground was vibrating &#160;because it was in my feet. It seems to move around to different areas of the body - sometimes I feel it in my legs, an arm, torso - it&#39;s quite random but often felt when I&#39;ve shifted position in bed. At first I thought it was circulatory but now I think it&#39;s probably neurological. I thought I was having palpitations but an ECG showed nothing abnormal. I&#39;ve also had a full spine &amp; brain MRI as I&#39;ve been having other strange symptoms of occasional numbness and sensations of burning and cold areas of my arms/hands and legs/feet and a sore tongue which comes and goes and often feels like I&#39;ve just cleaned my teeth with menthol toothpaste when I haven&#39;t. I thought I had all the signs of MS, but it hasn&#39;t been diagnosed. I&#39;ve also had a number of blood tests for immune issues, evoked potentials and nerve conductivity tests. Nothing! The MRI&#160;does show a lot of wear to my cervical vertebrae and two anterior spondylolisthesis - one cervical, one lumbar, so I wonder if my spinal issues could be the cause. My neurologist was doubtful. He also couldn&#39;t explain the vibration sensation except to say that it can be caused by a migraine, which I certainly haven&#39;t had.&#160;</p><p></p><p>I just don&#39;t know where to go with this now. &#160;My GP isn&#39;t interested and puts everything down to stress which I AM under it&#39;s certainly true to say, but I don&#39;t think she&#39;s right. I&#39;ve had to pay for all my neuro investigations as a result because she won&#39;t refer me or do any more blood tests etc. &#160;I&#39;m trying homeopathy, osteopathy and acupuncture as I want to find something that will relieve these weird symptoms and prefer to avoid drugs if I can.</p><p></p><p>I&#39;m 58, eat reasonably heathily, no alcohol, only 1 cup of coffee a day and&#160;my weight is normal. I broke my wrist badly at the end of August last year which is when my problems all seemed to start. i</p><p></p><p>I also wonder if the metal plate that was used to fix the fracture could be causing some kind of strange reaction.</p><p></p><p>If anyone else is having these symptoms please let me know if you&#39;ve been able to identify the cause and how to deal with it.&#160;</p>"

          " You seem to have the same symptons as me,,,very painful I did have a slipped disc about 30 years ago and went through life trying different exercises for my back and just putting up with the pain....privately I went to various specialists ...massage and manipulation and all my doctor said was that I probably had arthritis in my hips. I finally had an MRI scan which confirmed that it was Spinal Stenosis my doctor just explained that I had degeneration of my spine and suggested paracetamol.In 2010 the osteotherapist I was seeing privately suggested she write a letter to my doctor because I might benefit by going to a Pain Clinic which was something I hadn't even heard of. At last I saw a specialist who knew what was happening but he wasn't interested my my story just said I could have surgery which might work or tablets which again might work. I chose tablets to start off with. These were Pregabalin (Lyrica).I started off taking two a day morning and night and have now just increased to three a day after 12 months.They have relaxed my muscles in the thigh which has made me more comfortable.I am now unable to go out without leaning on someone or a shopping trolley and after about 1 hour am totally exhausted but I can sit down and am forever looking for the next seat.I have thought of acupuncture but haven't tried it yet. Because of my age I have resigned myself to this way of life but sometimes get a little depressed...I'd love to find someone else to chat to.  Since my last post I have had some massage followed by acupuncture and it has helped a little, I'm having a bit of remission though so not sure if the acupuncture would help when the acute pain comes. At the moment the pain is duller and easier to cope with but walking hasn't improved that much. The acupuncturist gives my back and leg a good massage which helps for a while. My doctor has said he will arrange surgery for me if I change my mind but I'm 76 and worry about complications such as pulmonary embolism or stroke afterwards as this has happened with 2 family members after surgery. If the pain comes back like it was a few months ago I may have no option as it was excruciating. I was sent for physic by two doctors and each time the physic said they couldn't help because I am quite flexible and could do anything they asked me to. I did Pilates for about twenty years so I am very supple, only symptom is the pain. I find lying flat on my back several times for ten minutes each time between chores helps. I have accepted that it won't get better and I will get trapped nerves again at some point but at the moment I'm coping. I find it frustrating as well as depressing as I have always been so active and enjoyed life and going out for days or holidays. I just keep thinking that there are people with much worse so shouldn't complain too much. Good luck and hope you get some relief soon. Hello to both of you. I have the same problem along with rheumatoid and osteoarthritis in just about all of me. I've had 6 surgeries, countless epidurals and injections (some worked for a short while, some didn't work at all) and bucket loads of pills. It doesn't sound as though you have adequate pain relief. These days no one should be left to suffer in pain. There are lots of types of medications to help chronic pain, including transdermal patches, sometimes it takes a while to find the ones that suit you best but there's bound to be something out there for you. Please think carefully and research fully any surgery you may decide to have. I know people who have had spinal surgery and wished they hadn't. It's a lot to go though and then find you still have to take pain medications and maybe not actually have gained anything at all. It is a frustrating and debilitating thing to have to live with. Gerry the Neck has posted a long post on this site called Cervical Spondylosis Ruminations, it's very helpful and informative and worth a read if you haven't already seen it. There are also other online forums such as Arthritis Care and Pain Support, both bring together people who suffer from various arthritic and other conditions to offer help and advice. Have you a comfortable mattress? a foam topper can often help sore joints. I'm sure you already know most things to help you feel more comfortable. Well I don't suppose I've actually helped but don't let age stop you looking for relief and help. I always say there was a serious design flaw when the human blueprint was drawn up...... What a life! Good luck to you both. Fanny Jane. Hello, I have to say the steroid injection was wonderful and left me pain free for several months. It has to be repeated as it does not last forever. Eventually I had a partial laminectomy. I have found accupuncture and Pilates and swimming to be of great benefit when done regularly and lifts the my mood when the pain is less. Laminectomy is not always the answer and can leave weakness in thigh and hip joint as it has done with me. I can walk perhaps 12 yards without a stick and I am fairly young - in my fifties. All started with herniated discs, sciatica, the usual symptoms which have ceased since the operation. Please don't let age put you off. The steroid injection was not painful and only a morning visit to hospital. I hope you are all feeling better since you posted and God Bless. Hi...thank you for writing .. I too started with a slipped disc 30 years ago, I am now in my mid-eighties and at the moment I'm not in too much pain I attended a pain clinic who prescribed a nerve drug so I'm using that at the moment. The most important thing is to keep positive and not let depression take over.I have several hobbies and lovely daughters who visit regularly. I often wish I had an internet or phone friend with the same problem but no luck so far. Hope you are all feeling well and continue to do so. God Bless... "

          "Had acute pain in right leg for 15 months which Gp was saying was hip and knee osteoarthritis and was prescribed cocodamol and later Tramadol which only took the edge off. Had knee and hip x-rays which showed minimal arthritis. Eventually I insisted on seeing a hip surgeon privately and he not only was the first person to listen to me but actually agreed that it was my spine. At last I was able to get an MRI scan done which confirmed lumbar spinal stenosis. The acute pain has eased now but I'm not able to walk far and have back pain as well as now both legs weak. I'm informed that steroid injection don't last long and surgery may have to be repeated after a couple of years or so. I'm not sure that it is worth the risk and considering to try acupuncture. I know there isn't a cure but some pain relief would be nice."

          " I was diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis in lower back 10 years ago, now I have pain in my neck top of spine going down I between shoulders, my arms knees back ribs and my knuckles are swollen and painful on my right hand. I think the pain down my spine is cervical spondylitis because my sister has just been diagnosed with that to go with her osteoporosis, my mum had rheumatoid arthritis my dad had osteoarthritis everyone in the family has it. The only time I am pain free is if I go swimming but it only lasts for a couple of hours, I take codeine and paracetamol but it does not get rid of the pain. I get the strangest symptoms I am 63 and just fed up with feeling terrible everyday... Osteoarthritis runs in my family...BOTH SIDES if my family, so I suspected that I would run into it SOMETIME. Looking back, I felt the first symptoms around age 30 when our first son was born. Symptoms came and went, however. I began taking Glucosimine to ward off trouble. I also used a heating pad for my lower back which would REALLY ACHE at times. I got a massager for my car seat. That helped A LOT because it also had HEAT. I began a walking program which helped me lose 80 pounds in 2007. I felt pretty good but needed to take Ibuprofen before I walked and needed to ICE and rest afterwards. In September of that same year I was on vacation and taking an evening walk. I stepped off the curb and felt a POP in the back of my right knee. One thing led to another, and pretty soon I was feeling pain in other parts of my knee, my back, etc. Physical therapy didn't help and actually made things worse. Also my 99 year old mother came to live with us for two years which produced GREAT RESPONSIBILITY, little sleep, and MUCH STRESS. It was during this time in 2011 and 2012 that the osteoarthritis hit with a vengeance. I think the stress, the little sleep, me being older (60), etc. really were the straws that broke the camel's back, so to speak, for me. Cortisone shots worked for four DAYS. My insurance wouldn't pay for the Ortho-Disc shots. I was TOTALLY FRUSTRATED, very upset, and IN DENIAL about everything. I started to think that wheelchairs and scooters were my future. One morning I woke to HORRENDOUS pain in my OTHER KNEE! I was unable to put any weight on my leg. I was using crutches. It was Memorial Day Weekend, so I had to wait several days until Tuesday when I could call my doctor. Long story short...got X-RAYS, bone-on-bone, no cartilage left. Doc said I needed TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENTS on both knees. I was shocked at how bad my knees had got in just four years. I booked my first knee surgery before I left the office. I will be getting my SECOND KNEE done in six weeks. My first knee is nine weeks post op. Surgery was the best thing I did. I will have OTHER PAIN, but at least my two knees will feel better. Don't be afraid of surgery. Sometimes it can be the only thing that helps the PAIN. I wish you a pain-free time!  Hi, I also have OA in upper and lower spine , lower is quite bad, right hip (badly) and left hip (mild),my knees are also starting to play up. Am waiting for the go-ahead for right hip replacement and will fight for the other joint as they deteriorate. I am the youngest child (67) of parents who were both arthritic but my brother and sister seem to have escaped it. Just the luck of the draw I suppose. It's good to come on here and have a rant to people who have some understanding of what you are going though. I hope you manage to get the best help you can xxx HI, I have had Arthritis since the age of 11, It started off as Septic Arthritis and now I have Osteoarthritis In my left knee, my right knee, my spine and my right foot. I have had a total knee replacement twice on my left knee plus several operations as a child and my right knee may be a partial knee replacement. I am still only just turned 59, my first knee replacement was at 39 and the second at 52. I also had broken my leg the second time. The first time I had to also have the Tibia straightened as my leg had bowed and the ligaments had gone In my groin. I know the pain and how debilitating Arthritis Is. I live on my own and have always struggled after my operations with very little support. I don't drive either so getting about as been problamatic. I often think about being In a wheelchair or scooter and that worries me. I walk with a stick now when I am out. I suffer nerve pain for the last 2 years. I take Gaberpentin for nerve pain, Naproxen for my spine I also take Nefopam and Codeine at night to help me sleep. I am still In constant pain. At least here there are people to talk to and understand what It's like to suffer Arthritic pain. I hope you find a way of coping. Best wishes. Elizabeth.  Hi, I too have spinal and multi joint OA. It started when I was quite young, early 40,s I think. Around the time of menopause anyway when I started to have problems with it. Severe back pain and sciatica (nerve pain down thigh), which was so painful I couldn't bear to walk and trying to go to the loo, (num 2) was virtually impossible! I've spent the last 30 years trying to come to terms with it. Not much help from the Docs really, just told to keep taking the tablets and learn to live with it as we're not able to cure it. The rest of my joints, neck, shoulders, elbows, hands, fingers, hips,knees, feet and toes have all followed on since then. I tried hydrotherapy in a warm pool at the local hospital but it was closed when the other hospital was rebuilt. Now we have one hydrotherapy pool for the whole county and city. It's virtually impossible to get an appointment now let alone a regular weeky session which really did help. I would recommend it if you have access to one locally and can get referrred. The warm water helps relax muscles making the exercise easier. I'm prescribed, Tramadol and paracetamol, Diclofenac which I've been told I have to cut down with a view to leaving it off as it's no longer advisable for elderly folk to use it. Recently I was prescribed some Amitriptylene for bedtime instead as I had Shingles in April. It does help me sleep better but not much help for the OA pain especially the spine. I find Valerian capsules (from health food shop)useful, sleeping betterand also to relax the muscles which spasm with overuse now my joints don't function so well. I'm now 72 and have bought a scooter, tried one on hol in Spain and found it very useful for getting around the resort. I also have a rollator with seat over shopping box, very useful if I need to go town on bus. I have my weekly shopping delivered, do it online now. So much easier than struggling with heavy bags. It's brought into the kitchen and I just have to put it away. I think this is what was meant by 'learning to live with it'! We have to adapt our lives round the disabilities. Finally, rest, rest, rest if your in pain. It's very tiring, I'm totally fatigued if I have to do housework, gardening, walking etc now. If I don't rest, my brain just doesn't function properly anymore and I start dropping things, making mistakes and generally don't function well at all! Sorry i can't give you any hope of a cure but i think you will be able to adapt if you put your mind to it. Best wishes, Ellie X :/ Hi Barbie. Have you asked Social Services for an assessment for your Dad? It sounds like he needs full time care now. You could also consider a temporary stay in a nursing home for him while you get the treatment you need so badly. (Respite care)! Ask at your GP's surgery for info how to contact SS in your area and speak to your Dad's GP too as they will need to know all his health details. You can also claim the carers allowance, ask SS about this too. Not meaning to sound bossy but I think you need help before you get too ill to take care of Dad! Take care of yourself first! Ellie X I have the same problems. Although i am only 26 i have severe osteoarthritis all over my body as well and nothing helps my pain and at times i cant even move or get out of bed."

          "Hi, I am new to this forum, and really am seeking any information I can find. Just wondering if anyone knows of or has osteoarthritis all over, I mean everywhere. I have it in my feet, ankles, knees, hips, spine, hands, fingers, and elbows and shoulders. My right hip is gone I need a total hip replacement, and I started having problems walking like my legs don't want to work about 3 months ago, since learned that the arthritis in my lumbar spine is severe, waiting for an MRI because the doctor thinks I have some kind of nerve compression or nerve damage. He also said the rest of the spine surely has some issues to, just from looking at how bad everything else is. Just ordered ex-rays again to see if the left hip is also gone or if most of that pain is from the back problems. I am worried I will end up in a wheelchair. I have had arthritis for several years and have been taking Tramadol and Ibuprofin 600 three times a day each for quite some time now, but the pain has become so severe that does not take care of it all. The Orthopedic doctor gave me two steroid shots in the lower spine area a couple of days ago, and that helped with the shooting pains going down my legs and buttocks (he said he thought was nerve pain), and that did help quite a bit with that part of the pain. I am 61 years old and although I knew the arthritis would \"get worse over time\" (as the Rheumatologist told me), I never dreamed I would be wondering if I am going to loose my ability to even walk or function. Thanks for listening..."

          " It is likely that CFS-type symptoms can result from a range of causes, many of which are not well understood or readily identifiable. The timing could indicate that bereavement played aa role, or it could not. Regardless, I don't think it's fair for you to be feeling guilty about your health - whatever the cause, that can only make you feel worse. Sory I don't really have any advice - best wishes though. Hi, I obviously can't tell you whats wrong, but I can tell you that you are not imagining it. Our stories start out very differently, but I have similar progress and thoughts to you in as much as sometimes I can do more and yet other times I can do practically nothing (am also currently awaiting an appointment with a rheumatologist). The times where I feel better I start to wander if i'm imagining it, or perhaps I could cope better in the bad times if I just tried harder. But then when the fatigue and pain hit you really hard again, you realise that would be impossible. I'm doing much better these days, getting up earlier and doing more throughout the day, but I still tire easily and take regular breaks and I still get my really bad days where I can't get out of bad early due to spine/neck pain and/or headache, but they are fewer than previously. My other half has his own business which I am hoping to get myself to a point where I can join him in the future, even if just on a part time basis or helping out to take the pressure off. Until recently he was also taking the strain around the house a lot, he enjoys cooking and still does a fair bit, but im glad i have been able to take on more on a daily basis, as I know what you mean about feeling guilty, its a useless ugly feeling, but you just can't help it. You feel like you should be able to do more, but then come the days (or weeks/months) where you just don't even have the energy to try. It's not you and it's not just in your head. Yes you have been through an awful lot and i'm sure it has played its part, but you have done all the right things to try and get yourself back into the swing of things, it sounds to me like you have tried all you can and thats all anyone can ask of you. I manage my symptoms with a very low carb/sugar diet, but I stress it is only managing my symptoms and not curing me. I don't necessarily believe starches/sugars are causing the problem, my best guess is that processing it is possibly just an extra stress on my system that my body doesn't cope with very well. I know there are differing opinions on this diet (and of course its not the answer for everyone anyway) but its helping for now, my insomina which I have suffered for years has gone away almost completely and i'm actually partaking in mornings these days. It can still take me 2 or 3 hours to feel like i want to be part of the world, but at least when that process begins at 7am rather than 10 I get to see more of the days, i'm thankful for that at least. I hope we both get some answers from the rheumatologist even if whatever it is just going to be helping and not fixing. Good luck dear Padiwhack, it does seem possible that you have a second bout of CFS/ME and maybe mild Fybro if there is such a thing as mild Fybro. I would suggest you browse the Group's Discussions. It will give you a good impression of the breadth of symptoms as well as the most common ones. Not pushing yourself does seem to be a universal component of recovery. Self doubt is a frequent stressor. Yet the evidence for the reality of CFS/ME is extremely well attested by a huge number of praviously healthy, energetic and well motivated people. That such people should choose to be lazy is abserd. That medical people should still think so is a disgrace but it can be said in mitigation but not exoneration that there is nothing in their box of pills that deals with this horrible ailment. I wish you success in your research and the patience and fortitude to make a good recovery. Hello Paddiwhack; I think the first reply that you will receive from ALL of us, is that NO, it's not in your head ! For myself, you seem to have gone down the Exact same path as I....you know that there is \"something\" wrong with you, but just can't find an answer, and go through ALL the testing that is available to the Health Industry, including Lumbar Puncture for MS, etc etc; and still no definitive answer...but you know....and yes, this forum, and all the knowledgeable people will guide you, and support you, for there are quite a few who do their own research, and take info to their GPs and Voila...you come away with an answer to your questions/feelings. Your symptoms, and tiredness certainly sound similar to mine...and I know that I fit into Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue; and although some doctors don't agree totally with these diagnosises, you yourself will know...keep typing to us, and work through your feelings .....hear back soon...Bro"

          "First time for me on any group. After some guidance/opinions. my history is that 14 years ago my brother died with cancer. He was 36 I was 35 . About 18 month after I suffered extreme fatigue couldn't work much at all and was in the process of investigation when we emigrated. The consultant didn't give me an opinion just said moving is the best thing I can do for my health. After about three more years I began to gain strength and became almost the same busy energetic woman I have always been. 2010 my mum was diagnosed with lung cancer. We were very close, she lived with us her and I nursed her when the time came after lots of chemo etc. she was sick for about 17 months. She died sept 2012. March 2013 I was struggling again with total fatigue, wiped out type tiredness. Aching muscles painful joints, poor concentration, head ached, visual acuity not always good, worse when more tired. Unable to work much at all. My husband does almost everything and I feel incredibly guilty. gp thought depression after bereavement . I had my doubts but agreed to try anti depressants and I paid for private counselling as I believe the two therapies go hand in hand. Now I feel no better, if anything worse and have had bloods 3x all ok . After agreement with psychiatric consultant I have been referred to my go and at my request referred to rheumatologist. i await an appoint,net. At times I begin to think I am imagining all this. Some days better than other but if I try and ignore it I pay for it. i guess I feel a need to know what is wrong. The thought of living with this indefinitely is horrendous. We are trying to run a business and as I am overseas there is no financial support. i am sorry I know there are many of you with worse symptoms but your opinions would be very gratefully received. By the way my hubby is extremely supportive and understanding but I know he is finding it hard too."

          " I am so sorry to read about your painful experience and would just like to say that I can't possibly imagine how distressing it must be. I am an osteopath with a couple of patients with Sheurmanns. Honestly, I am able to give them a bit of relief with their achiness but it only lasts maybe a couple of weeks. Strong mobilisation of the whole area should help to ease it a little and I would recommend that you consider an osteopath as they really do work on the integration of the whole body. It may help with your pain although I do understand that it probably should have been done a long time ago in order for it to be fully effective. Regards Hi My husband has scheuermanns disease too &amp; at 38 he is beginning to suffer more than ever before. We have only been together for 3yrs &amp; I have only recently discovered that his condition has a name! so i have been researching alot! I hope that you are feeling more positive (if thats possible) now. I have to say your post shocked me somewhat! I wont say I have been blind to the possibilities of having to care for him at a later stage, but Im hoping it will be a long time from now! best wishes Carol  hi im 19 and suffer from scheuermanns disease was diagnosed with it when i was 14, i really feel for you, my docters are useless because of my age can only be givin tramadol, some days i cant even get out of my bed its that sore, i hope you manage to find some help soon xx Hi I am a similar age I am 51 and have been unable to work for the last 20 years. Sleeping was a major issue waking every 20-30mins to turn over when the pain in my ribs got too bad to sleep then eventually managing to fall asleep again. You start every day feeling tired miserable and in constant pain, I know the hell you are experiencing. Now it may or may not help you, but 4 years ago I bought a memoryfoam mattress and since that day I now sleep almost the entire night through it has made a world of difference to me, of course I am still in pain but at least I am not worn out through lack of sleep as well. I just wish someone was doing extensive research into this condition as both my children have it also my son was diagnosed at 10 years old my daughter at 13, I want better for them than the life it has forced on me, but apart from seeing a consultant about every 2 years to check on the conditions progress nothing is offered, they say its not hereditary so are we just really unlucky, I dont think so and just wish for more support. Meds are my only option I cannot tolerate Morphine makes me violently ill so I get little relief from the drugs I can take. Surgery has been suggested but on the advice of 3 different ortho surgeons I have declined it, as they think it would be very dangerous very unsuccessful and would probably put me straight in a wheelchair or at worse leave me paralysed from the neck down IF I survived the surgery itself. The future is bleak so basically I just take each day as it comes and enjoy doing as much as I can, I push myself constantly then spend hours trying to get the pain under control again, but if i just sit their moping I am going to be worse off so I grit my teeth and go for it, I love gardening and walking (although not far) and refuse to stop but yes the pain is horrendous but its going to be there anyway. Go for the surgery.... I got it diagnosed about 12 years ago. I am now 39. I had major hip and back pain right through high school making me miss school and be restricted on my physical activities. I continued to get worse and my GP just kept trying to 'crack it back'. Then finding a good spinal consultant my life changed. I finally got diagnosed, yes it took time but even after the initial spine operation ( they inserted two rods from the top of my shoulders to the upper part of my lower back, fused some discs and inserted some \"false\" disks, ) it was amazing. Don't get me wrong, still had a lot of pain but nothing like it was, and I finally stood tall. My wife told me all the time to remember how I was and remember how much better I am. My only problem now... The first holiday we took after I felt my best for years, we were just outside Newquay (Cornwall,UK) stopped at a junction when a speeding van came around a bend behind us and hit us at over 60MPH smashing us across the road, through a wall and some road signs and into the side of someone's house. The crash ripped all the metal work (screws) out of my spine and snapped my spine in more than 7 places. Devastating. But being the stubborn patient I am , after two operations on the spine in my neck ( two disks had snapped and one was crushing the spinal chord ), and three operations on my back, I am back up walking around. I still take morphine and a lot of other medication on a daily basis, but from the outside, I look like nothing is wrong. Which really boosts how I feel about myself. I have two fantastic and caring kids that help as well as a loving wife. I have another operation due soon, which is hopefully going to be the last. But all the way through all of this. In all the pain and discomfort I have experienced. Nothing, nothing at all, would make me wish at the beginning that I never went for surgery. Before surgery, as well as the curve, my spine began to crumble. So I was constantly having to try to lie down over my buckles, or bent weirdly, to pop slipped disks back in myself. They were popping every day, sometimes every hour. The initial operation stopped all that, stopped the discomfort and a lot of the pain, and made me stand tall and look forward to life rather than wish for the day it would end. Which I did seem to wish for an awful lot. I have read its hereditary so am about to get my son checked. We got told to leave it until he was 11 to get him checked. My heart felt sympathy goes to you all and to everyone living with this problem and those like it. I got diagnosed with scheurmanns, spondulitis, severe arthritis in the base of the spine, and \"another\" causing the spine to crumble. Finally, after my moan to you, I simply meant to write \" please have the operation, mine changed my life so much for the better I cannot express to you how much better I am now, both physically and especially mentally. I used to feel such a burden to everyone around me, i wished for the end to come and stop the pain. But, thanks to my incredible spine consultant, I can now look to the future with head held high and enjoy it with my family. I hope this all makes sense as I have waffled on but have never written about this before and just got carried away ! Take care everyone and I hope you all get to a point where you too have less pain and a brighter future ahead of you. Hi all, It's been a while since I made my last post (I'm 55 this year - 2013). Scheuermann's isn't hereditary (I checked when I was first diagnosed), and fortunately our grown-up 'kids' and grand children aren't affected, though the physical pain is now totally unbearable and no matter how much Morphine and other oral non-effective rubbish I take, it just has no affect any more and I'm now getting chronic neck and headache as well (like extreme migraine and whiplash). Unless someone knows someone somewhere that would look at me, there is no surgery that any of the consultants have said I can have for this condition that they will perform and I find myself on life's scrapheap. My wife is beside herself with worry as she can't help me and has to watch me suffer on a daily basis. I'm ready to take all my meds, a bottle of alcohol (I've been teetotal for 3 years due to taking the Morphine and other medications), drive to my parents grave and end it all there as there I simply cannot take it any more. If I were a dog, the Vet would've put me to sleep to 'avoid further suffering'. So much for modern medicine and compassion eh? I'm not sure that I'll be around beyond my 55th birthday in August. Additionally, my knees are in chronic pain now as well, and standing or walking is a nightmare. I would happily be put under semi-permanent sedation than to be expected to live like this as it's no longer life . . it's a very, very, very painful existence that no-one ought to be made to suffer. I must've been a really bad person in any previous life to deserve this as my penance. I've signed the Donor Register so the medical fraternity might learn something from my cold rotting carcass, but I'm begging anyone that knows of anyone anywhere that could at least stop this from deteriorating further and/or help me to live whatever life I may have with some sort of purpose and meaning and to become as pain free as possible, I would trade almost anything just to be pain free. I've barely left the house in 3 years. Please, if anyone can help, I'm at the end of my tether and ability to cope with the pain and suffering, both for myself and for my family. I contacted Stoke Mandeville Hospital, but they said they couldn't help because they deal with spinal injuries only. For Mattrys, who is your spinal consultant and can you ask if they would be prepared to look at my case? Sorry for the post being so morbid, but I really can't convey it any other way. It's my last plea for help.  Hi again, firstly glad to see your kids are fine. I've had such contradicting information about hereditary or not. I feel so sorry for you not being sorted before now. Previous to any operation I would collapse all the time both in pain, or by having nerves compressed and then getting sharp pains and numbness through both neck and legs. As bad as my back got, I think my neck far superseded it. But the operations have made a huge difference to me. My consultant is Mr Paul Rhys Davies. He operates under NHS at Llandough Hospital, Penarth (right next to Cardiff) and privately at the Vale Hospital ( near Llantrisant ). I have had operations by him and his registrars and always felt such a benefit after it. The pain in neck and back got so severe I could not sit or stand for more than 15 mins at a time, and couldn't lie down. It was a nightmare. Many many times I wanted to end it but after the operation I was up and walking around after just 24 hours. My wife came in to visit and I met her in the cafe ! It was amazing. I then had an operation on the neck which sorted the rest out. My spinal chord had got crushed by a disk collapsing and apart from pain was causing a serverly sharp pain through my neck and head and felt like a soldering iron in the back if the eye. But it has stopped. Just a pity I had a crash that messed it all up. I will ring Paul's secretary for you today to see how you can get seen quickly. My father has a similar condition as in under a new consultant and really recommends him. He has also had a few spine operations and a knee operation. The new consultants lists are alot shorter. ( I think he was one of Paul's registrars ). I will find out his name and repost. I'll keep my fingers crossed you can get sorted, and will get back as quick as I can with the information. Take care.  Hi all Similar situation Pirate I am 54 diagnosed with SD late @31 unfortunately both my children have inherited it so guess I they are just unlucky ! Mr Paul Rhys Davies was also my consultant and after many years it was suggested I should have spinal stabilisation surgery so I agreed after holding out for many years (this was 4 years ago) While on the waiting list for the surgery I was called in to see another consultant who after reviweing my MRIs and other info spent an hour with me explaining why in his opinion I should not have the surgery - he felt the risks in my case were very high and the outcome would not be successful due to the excessive neck curvature he told me 'the rods would not hold and would burst out of the back of my skull' delightful thought heh ! obviously requiring further surgery with higher risks until they ran out of bone to reattach them. Its apparently further complicated as I have a tumor (haemangioma) inside T11 which woud make me prone to a bleed into the spinal cord heightening the risk of paralysis. I was told to think it over and return in 6 months. On my return visit I saw another consultant who agreed that I was not suitable for the surgery which coincidentely was the exact information I had been given 20 years earlier by my very first consultant at the Spinal Unit in Nuffield Oxford ( when I lived there). With all this new information I declined the surgery and now exist on pain relief which is being steadily increased all the time. It has been 4 years since I saw Mr Paul Rhys Davies in Llandough and have asked to be referred back again to discuss my options again - who knows maybe there is something that can be done now. I do feel for you as I too just want some damn relief from this chronic pain and limitations put on my life by it.. Ohh yes to add insult to injury ATOS declared me 'Fit for work' ! so add all the stress being stripped of my benefits brings while I appeal this decision with my GPs full support. Life really does suck sometimes but then I look at my kids who despite having SD are both at Uni and doing well and are happy hopefully the future will hold better treatments and results for them. Just for info my son was diagnosed at 10 and my daughter at 13. I too have scheuermanns disease, was diagnosed as a teenager then it, I think went into remission, if that's what you would call it. I started having backache again at 30 was x rayed and yes there it was again. I am now 50 and it has got a lot worse in the past 20 years. I have developed sciatica, degenerative disc disease, cervical spondolosis and costal chondritis where the ribs attach the breastbone. My curvature isn't as severe as it could probably get but I have helped myself there with braces and standing as straight as possible. I am taking morphine morning and night and also 3 times during the day. Amitryptylline is one of the best medications for the condition and this has recently been doubled as the pain has become more severe. It does knock me out so Im dopey for half the day as well but I'm not bothered about that, I would rather be in less pain. I'm also on pregabalin which I found better than gabapentin (lyrica) it would be worth a try for the other sufferers. I take diclofenac but have to take omeprazole for the stomach problems. I am on paracetamol too, and beta blockers as I have heart palpitations. I'm also on HRT for peri menopause and to stop osteoporosis which is more susceptible in people with scheuermanns. I take fluoxetine for depression and tolterdine for bladder problems as I had a prolapse 5 years ago as my bladder had become 1 1/2 times the size it should have been as I barely needed to pass urine the urge was not there I think due to medication. I have been advised surgery would not be possible due to the degenerated discs but I have had my vertebraes realigned by a bonesetter There were 4 thoracic and cervical vertebraes out and lumbar 3 and 4 which are the ones which cause the terrible sciatica which has now appeared in the underside of my right foot which is agony. He is a very highly regarded gentleman who has helped people all over the world, many top celebrities who could get no relief from other therapies they tried. This man is in Scotland which was fine for me just a 2 hour drive but I don't know the whereabouts of the other sufferers,. I would gladly give them his telephone number but must stress he deals with the nerve pain associated from the back and not joint pain but please get in touch with me if you would be interested in talking to him. It would be good to have a scheuermanns disease self help group in the UK but as said before don't know where the other sufferers live. I have a big worry coming up the ATOS questionnaire as I'm on incapacity benefit, I'm terrified of this. And as the last person said they have been declared fit for work and having to appeal. Do you not get an assessment rate prior to your appeal happening? Also, I read that it can take a year to get your appeal heard but 70% of people are having their benefits returned then so I assume they would then backdate your money. Any help regarding answers would be gratefully appreciated as they will not believe I have scheuermanns disease as my own doctor didn't even believe it until she saw my x rays!! Many thanks Hello everyone. I just read all your above comments and I sympathise greatly with you all. I have a condition in my lower back, called scoliosis. It is called a curvature of the spine I know my mother had it but I did not have myself diagnosed with it, although I was in plaster as a baby apparantly, they didn't investigate any further! Anyway all through the years I have had back pain on and off, and certainly as I have got alot older After being told continuously by previous doctors, that I Had sciatica trapped nerves in my lower back. Well they were wrong! Just recently I went to an osteopath through my new doctor when I moved again, only to find on my diagnosis that they found I have sciosis curvature in my lower spine, with 1 cm left leg shorter than the right! Anyway I have started therapy classes at my local hospital. I went for my first session yesterday. I have found it very helpful indeed. I learnt about pain how to manage it how to understand about it, and also why it has happened! We also did soft exercises and the breathing exercise was brilliant mind you apart from being in touch with your body lying down you can easily fall asleep! But I felt refreshed and much better in myself only after one session of it. But I do recommend meditation of the body, you really get in touch with yourself in your body you become the controller using your brain in a much better focused way in helping your pain. It really does help! I am also going to do Pilates too so watch my comments next time im on here, I will answer your questions about anything on my progress. Thanks for reading my post huggs to you all bless you x I am 54 years old and have been suffering with this disease since I was in my early 30s. I was initially diagnosed with sciatica, though no one could tell me why I developed it. I was diagnosed with arthritis in my spine at 27. The legs started hurting long before the back did but when the back pain started, it was relentless. Still is. I understand what you are all going through. After declining both surgery and pain killers, I found the best solution for me is weight lifting. I use barbells and dumbbells, rather than machines. The machines are fine to begin with but they restrict your movement and you don't get the most workout of all muscles. The free weights work more muscles more effectively. Hire a personal trainer before you begin and start with an empty bar. The goal is not to become a body builder but to increase the strength of your muscles, which will help to alleviate the pain caused by the bones. As you continue, slowly add weight to the bar. The stronger your muscles, the more your bones will maintain their properly alignment, the less pain you'll feel. It's the same concept that makes the memory foam mattress work so well during sleep. I hope this information is helpful to anyone else who is suffering with this disease. "

          "I was diagosed with Scheurmanns when I was 22. I am now 50. Apart from being prescribed Oral Morphine and other 'pain killers', and having had CT and MRI scans, X-Rays, direct pain killing injections (including epidural), the condition continues to get ever more painful and progressively worse by the month. Lower limb movement is now severely restricted and with the problem now affecting other areas (neck, shoulder and basically all of the spine), coupled with excessive fluid in the spinal cord in the neck, the pain is now virtually unbearable. I cannot help myself any more and the medics/doctors seem unable or unwilling to help. The prognosis (as far as I'm concered) is that I will be left to suffer the pain, and the task of affording any personal help, left to my wife. I don't wan't this for her. I'm thinking un-Christian thoughts, and do not know ho much more of this I can take. I wouldn't wish this condition on anyone, and even when I see a 'specialist', am basically left to my own devices. So much for serving your country (I'm ex military) and advances in medical science. For some of us, these things mean little when you are trapped inside your own body racked in unimaginable pain. Loved ones can do nothing other than worry themselves sick over you. All I would ask for is the opportunity to be seen by a spinal spcialist, but my 'consultant' seems not to be willing to re-refer me. For those of you who have this condition, my thoughts are very much with you. I just feel that I'm now on lifes scrap heap, and frankly there's not much reason to remain in my mortal form (family aside). I hope that anyone reading this will be afforded far better medical aid than I have thus far. Internet research suggests that there are clinics than can help, so why won't the clinitians make the referral? I guess it's down to cost. My life isn't worth a damn. I've paid my dues (taxes) and served my time (military), now I'm on lifes scrap-heap and no-one gives a damn. Sorry, I just get so angry at times. After months without a proper night's sleep, it gets to you. At 4am when the pain wakes you up, and during the day you wipe away the tears from the pain, enough becomes enough."

          " I have osteoprosis at 44 with a T score of -3.9 in the lumbar spine, generally there is no pain with osteoporosis unless you have fractures or it has transpired a kyphosis of the spine and the nerves have pressure, it is very important that you are proactive with follow up appts and having another bone scan to see if there has been changes, preferably you should use the same machine that took your last scan to insure accuracy in the results, you are the most important role in your healthcare, write down questions, symptoms as they occur and discuss with your provider, and with your age you should ask to see an endocrinologist, they specialize in treatment of this disease and can determine if hormonal imbalances could be the cause...  They may well not do too much for osteopenia but you do need some advice and help. There is the osteoporosis society but better to talk to yr doctor and get a referral. You need to look up vitamin D and Vitamin K2. You should be in pain unless you have a fracture. Where is the pain? Exercise is essential but one has to be careful. Walking good but of course all depends on the pain. Have you had your hormone levels checked? Please see someone and get referred. You are very young to be dealing with this all on your own.  I'm 25 and, like you was diagnosed with osteopenia aged 20 which became full blown osteoporosis last year. It is gutting having to be so careful so young. I don't know about the pain you are in - low bone density in itself shouldn't cause pain - only the fractures it causes. If there is an underlying cause of your osteopenia (for me it was severe mulnutrition and anorexia) then these may be causing your pain (eg. due to muscle weakness, easier sprains and fatigue etc.) rather than the osteopenia itself. Let me know if you get any further advice. I have only been given vitamin D (tested low) and calcium, as apparently the usual treatments are not shown to be effective for our age group. I would advise walking extra where possible (like park further away from work/shops - provided it isn't icy!) and maybe yoga or other low impact risk weight baring exercise. Best of luck with it all, and especially with having children - I have ths problem too and know how saddening and frustrating it can be. Remember there are always other options."

          " Good morning. It is a difficult decision to make as to whether or not to take Alendronic acid isn't it. I am 60, and have taken 6 tablets now. The first 4 were ok, until the day before I was due to take my weekly dose, when I felt really rough, and developed diahorea. Decided it couldn't possibly be the pill, so took the next one. Felt generally unwell, but didn't think it was connected. On taking the 6th dose, I found I was dizzy, shaky, and when I sat down, had the most weird feeling in my stomach. Rang the Dr, who said take 2 Ranitidine now, and again tonight. Did this which stopped the weird feeling, but have felt rough ever since. Very shaky, and dizzy, and stiff joints. Tummy churning, and diahorea again. Saw the Dr, who seemed to think it could well be the Alendronic acid. She suggested stopping it for 4 weeks to see how I got on. Then maybe give it another try, or try something else. I have always taken a calcium supplement, as my Mother and Grandmother had osteoporosis. Am now taking Calci chews, which the Dr prescribed. My problem at the moment is, that I have suffered from anxiety a few months ago, and am now wondering if any of my current symptoms could be that. I wasn't feeling anxious about the pill before I felt strange, so now I suppose I have to sit it out for a week, and see if the symptoms subside. Don't want my spine to crumble, but can't live like this. :( Good evening. Sorry you have been feeling so rough. Since I posted this last comment I have been feeling very much better - I stopped the drug with my doctor's agreement and the racing erratic heart beat was a problem no more, I gradually began to feel more energetic and more like my old self. The tendon and muscle problems have yet to resolve but the digestive problems - heartburn, acid reflux and tummy upsets have also settled - I have crohn's disease, an inflmamatory bowel condition and can do without added complications. I see my hospital consultant in August so it will be interesting to hear what she has to say!! Incidentally my last bone scan gave a score of -2.2. Many years ago I suffered for a time with panic attacks but these recent symtoms were quite different and clearly related to some other cause. I hope with time you will begin to feel better and healthier. It will do no harm to go off the drug for a while and see if your symptoms improve - you are merely keeping your options open. It is difficult to know what to do for the best but I believe in following my instincts, coupled with an open mind. Being positive and confident about making a decision to help yourself I'm sure will be of great benefit. I too have been on calchichew (D3 Forte) for about 8 years. I continue to take that, eat healthily and exercise whenever possible. I can't help but feel there is too much scare mongering in respect of the need for preventive medecine - something my GP also supports. I am 53 and naturally want to be as healthy as possible, but I don't want to exchange a ''perceived risk'' with an actual harmful side effect. I realise that I may need to try another drug in the future but I do believe that I am doing the right thing for me at the moment being Alendronate free. I will keep you posted. All the best, hope you are feeling better already. :) Thank you for that. I have stopped taking the Alendronic acid, as advised by the doctor, because I felt so unwell. I should have taken the 6th pill today, so I am hoping I shall start to feel better soon. Now I am unsure if the achey back is due to Osteoporosis, or Alendronic acid. The doctor says go back in 4 weeks, and we can look at something else, but everything seems to have side effects. I know it won\u2019t necessarily mean I will get them, but it is worrying. Considering trying some extra supplements, as I have read that Magnesium is good for the bones. It is a nightmare isn\u2019t it! Kind regards, Julie. :o) 2 years later! Hope u guys r doing well at the moment. I'm 23 and hav had crohns for most of my life, I've been told I've taken alendronic acid before but it must hav been a good few years ago because I don't remember it apart from the name. I've recently been subscribed it by my specialist at st marks and decided to research a bit before I start. Alot of people seem to hav problems with it and I'm already on methotrexate which makes me feel lousey anyway so I'm feeling a bit aprehensive about taking it. I've also read that it can cause gastrointestinal ulcering which definitly doesn't sound good for a crohns patient. Have you found out anything more since you posted and would u recommend I talk to my GP or specialist before starting. If you (or anyone else that has any info on the subject) manage to read this, any advice would be appreciated. Thanks, Reguards Max Hi there I was beginning to think that I was imagining this. I'm on steroids and take AA every Wednesday and I always feel awful; achy, flulike symptoms, sometimes upset stomach, shivvering and cold. As I am coming off the steroids I'm hoping to stop tA soon too. I hope you get some answers soon .  Hi All, This is very interesting to me. I have ulcerative colitis and after 2 years of repeated high doses of steroids I have been put on to alendronic acid. i have been taking it for about 4 months and although I have not noticed any acute symptoms I am aware of a burning sensation in my stomach and general queasiness after taking it. What I hadn't linked was the chronic fatigue and fuzzy head as these are side affects of the disease anyway. What I really wanted to say is that I have found out today that you must not get pregnant whilst taking this or any other bisphosphonates or in fact for at least 2 years after taking it. This has come as a horrible shock to me, I always read the leaflets that come with medicines and I am sure that it did not mention the 2 year break before pregnancy, nor did my consultant. If I had known this I would not have taken it as starting a family is high on my agenda, something I have already been warned might not be easy and require yet more medical intervention. Hope this information is helpful to somebody.  I stopped taking alendronic acid after EIGHT YEARS of being on it. I had been blindly taking it once a week after having been prescribed it all those years ago because I had been diagnosed with osteoporosis in my spine. It wasn't until I went to my dentist a couple of months ago that I really learnt about the effects of it. Luckily my old dentist had emigrated and a new one went through the list of medication I was on and told me about a condition that people can get if they have been on alendronic acid for a long time, something my other dentist had never mentioned. It's called osteonecrosis of the jaw. He said that because I had been on alendronic acid for so long it was highly likely that if I needed to have a tooth out I would have to have it done in hospital because there is a high risk of the bones of my jaw crumbling and not healing properly. After I had seen him I went home and looked up alendronic acid and teeth and was shocked to read that some people had only been on the drug a couple of months or slightly longer before getting problems with it. There is a lot of information about the drug and some of it is to do with trials or research where the results say that there MAY be a connection with this or that so no definite proof but while there is the slightest hint that there might be something bad about taking the drug I think people should be aware of what might happen. Apparently the drug stays in your body for 10 to 12 YEARS after you stop taking it! There's speculation that rather than strengthening the bones it can make them more brittle, caused by the fact that it stops the production of new bone and just strengthens the old stuff meaning that you end up with dense but brittle bones. There is a fairly rare problem where people have been on the drug for a while and they get sudden breakages of their femurs caused in an insignificant way, for example slipping off a kerb or shifting their weight onto one leg. One survey found that of all the people who had experienced these breakages, something like 93% had been on alendronic acid. They had reported pains in their thighs for some months before, along with muscle weakness and these are the symptoms that I had been experiencing for about three months. My right thigh would ache a lot when I did more than just walking around the house. As for muscle weakness, I was finding that if I lifted anything heavy one of my legs would give way. The most recent event was when I was putting on a pair of trousers, standing on my left leg while I put my right leg in and it was just as if someone had kicked my left leg from under me and I fell with my right leg raised and landed on the base of my hip joint. Thankfully I don't appear to have broken anything. I went to the doctor, armed with some printouts from the internet which didn't endear me to her and said that I had been having the pains and muscle weakness and had read that problems can occur after being on them and that five years should be the maximum to be on them. She got out her little drug book and said \"Well it doesn't say that here\" and I thought No, it probably doesn't as that is more than likely issued by the drug company who makes the tablets! She has reluctantly agreed that I should try staying off them for a while but I intend to stay off them for good. Even if there is a risk that my bones will get more brittle, if the drug is causing me pain and muscle weakness which leads to falls then I'd rather take the risk. I'm not one to suddenly fall over after losing my balance, all the falls I've had, which aren't that many, have been caused by me standing on a chair and falling off, tripping over a carpet, slipping down the stairs because I wasn't wearing any shoes etc. and not just by losing my balance. The doctor, by the way, didn't do anything about the muscle weakness or aching thighs but she did grudgingly order a blood test to check my calcium levels, something they are supposed to do before they put you onto a calcium supplement. Research on alendronic acid lead me on the finding out about the other drugs I am on. I take Omeprazole for heartburn but apparently alendronic acid can cause heartburn and calcium can cause heart attacks. After popping an Omeprazole every day while on alendronic acid, since I have stopped taking them I have only had one bout of it and that was caused, I think, by stress. To sum up, I think that whenever people are put on ANY drugs, they should not only read the information leaflet that comes with the medication but they should look it up on the internet when they will REALLY find out about the drug because although the drug companies give possible side effects in their information, it's not the same as getting it straight from the people who actually take the stuff which means that all the niggling things that you thought were just old age are more than likely down to the drugs that doctors seems to dish out like sweets without thinking of the long term consequences. Sorry this has gone on so long but I've got a real bee in my bonnet now about prescribed drugs! I am Male aged 82. I was prescribed alendronic acid and calchichew (D3 Forte) a year ago, after my lower lumbar region severely collapsed. Probably caused by gardening and lifting my wife to a sitting position every morning, for about 18 months I have 2 collapsed vertebrae T10 and T12. Since then the arthritis in my ankles and knees have got considerably worse. I also have itching everywhere, only mild, but an annoyance. I also get tendon pains in my left leg, when I lie down. This gets worse until I can find a position where it goes away. I also get indigestion every night. I mentioned this to my doctor, but was advised to try to put up with it. It wasn't then as bad as it is now. (3 months ago). I thought I was on my own with these side effects, thinking that the doctor would know from experience and would tell me if it was common. I am now going to stop taking the tablets for a months trial. To keep the records straight ,I will tell the doctor when I see him next week I have just found this forum, as I have just been prescribed Alendronic Acid and am not sure that I will take them due to the horrific possible side-effects. I am 79, and have always been healthy, reasonably active, until I fell and broke my leg about 18 months ago. My doctor referred me for a bone density test, which I had a few weeks ago. The doctor's receptionaist phoned me yesterday to say the results were in, I have signs of osteoporosis, and the doctor prescribed Alendronic Acid and CalcichewD3. I have not started them yet. I had already been taking Calcium with vitamins D and K for a year (buying them myself) I don't know the actual result of my bone density test, but I can't help feeling that in view of my age and the fact that I did break a leg the hospital and/or GP may assume that I am bound to have osteoporosis! Before I broke my leg, I went dancing two or three times a week - energetic dancing like quicksteps and jives - so had plenty of exercise. I am now getting back to dancing although not so often or quite so energetic as before, but this is improving. My broken leg was not the result of losing my balance and it was the first time in my life I had ever broken a bone - other falls have resulted in pulled muscles or sprained ankles. My point is that I defy anyone who falls down a flight of concrete steps -merely by not looking where she was going -not to break something whatever their age or strength of their bones! Hello everyone! I am an over 60 female. I had a scan after breaking a bone in my foot this summer and have been diagnosed with Osteoporosis of the spine and \"thin hip bones\" (thank goodness for a layer of cushioning fat, great for soft landings!) I have taken my 4th Alendronic acid tablet this morning. I have noticed aching limbs at night, more than is usual for me. Now, one leg is aching and I know I will have trouble sleeping tonight. Again. I have had to take Paracetamol Plus in the middle of the night to ease aching bones since taking these tablets. I had read the leaflet already, but looked on line and found this forum. Having read this thread, I am resolved to ring my GP in the morning! I also take Calcichew D3 Forte twice daily (although I keep forgetting them, not yet being used to the regime and being rather forgetful!) Hopefully these will do no significant harm. I wonder what my GP will have to say... Female 55. Havent had any broken bones but the dentist found my problem in my jaw, after persistent absyses. she was trying to put me off the drug too. I have just taken possession of my first pack of Alendronic acid and after reading the side effects decided to make an appointment with another doc at the surgery to discuss. I dont like the sound of them at all and after reading the comments on this forum am convinced that I am not going to take them. I am going to do more research but it does not sound like a good drug at all. .....going Thursday, I wonder what the GP will say too.,... "

          "Thought it may be of help to get matters in perspective. Do look at the site at **** on bonehealth and osteoporosis. Wish I had read more before I started taking the drug. I have now stopped it, convinced that my joint and tendon problems, racing heart and general and increasing awful feelings of fatigue and illness are linked to the start of taking alendronic acid. I understand now why my GP was a bit reluctant to prescribe it in the first place but I trusted my hospital consultant and believed he would be looking after me for the good. Maybe this trust was a bit misplaced?

          " Hi Lori: Sorry to hear about your diagnosis and pain problems. Is the pain constant or intermittent? Is it aggravated by cold climate, physical or emotional stress, or all of the above? How long have you had this condition? Do you have other trauma or related injuries, such as whiplash or falls? I got the same diagnosis as you in October. I did not have as good a palette of medications as you describe, but do take Tylenol or NSAIDs, Tramadol (as needed, Hydrocodone (5/325) as needed, muscle relaxers (Methocarbomal aka Robaxin, or SPZM, an herbal formula), lorazepam for anxiety as needed, and Ambien for sleeping issues when the pain keeps me awake at night. I also used an inflatable cervical traction unit I found on Amazon that costs $30 US (Instapark brand, Amazon part B00573S4KI). It helped a lot at first. I also have an inversion table, too, but it does not seem to help with issues related to C5-C6, but is great for lumbar and mid-back issues. Spent hundreds of dollars to get a new mattress and pillow and then went through mattress pads on Amazon trying to get one that did not aggravate my symptoms. Finally got there after several tries. Sleep is that important, IMHO. I am getting a little better since my peak symptoms in October, but the pain is more chronic, so I would personally disrecommend surgery unless your pain is constant and unbearable. This was the recommendation of the two best neurosurgeons in Florida for me - I went to both, as I had good insurance. Everything helped some, including the sterioid injection in my cervical spine, but what helped me the most was ACCUPUNCTURE. I have now had about 21 sessions. I started with sessions 2 times per week, then reduces it to 1 x per week. Insurance paid for the first 15. After the very first session, I only had about 4 hours of pain relief. But it was 4 hours of real relief... 8 hours after the 2nd and 3rd, but it got more consistent after that, like peeling layers of a pain onion, if you will. It does not make the bone spur or the stenosis go away, so physical activity, which was almost impossible before, is now possible but then aggravates my condition. So, I now go to the accupuncturist one time per week to manage my chronic symptoms. And, I try to take a muscle relaxer every night before I go to bed, as I find that reduces my symptoms. If you dont have a good accupuncturist in your area, then I would suggest deep tissue massage therapy instead, starting at 2X/week, focusing on the upper back and neck. Again, think \"pain and spasm onion\". If your pain is constant and intolerable, then I would suggest you try the cortizone injection or accupuncture or deep tissue massage therapy BEFORE surgery. Surgery is not always the best option for this problem, as about 35% get no relief or more pain afterwards. Given that, it makes sense to try everthing but surgery unless the pain is unbearable. In my case the surgical option was remove the disc and either replace it with an artificial one or fuse the two vertabrae together. If I am faced with that choice in the near future, I would opt for the artificial disc first, as you can always get a fusion if that does not work, but once fused, there is no other option. I even asked, \"cant you just go in there with a laser and get rid of the bone spurs\"? The answer was \"no\" - that works for the lumbar region, but not for the cervical spine. There is this little known treatment, which is an alternative therapy, available here in Florida and the US, called PROLOTHERAPY, where they inject the affected areas of your cervical spine with an irritant to cause it to heal from injury, but even though it is available in my area, I am not sure of its effectiveness; most insurance companies wont pay the thousands required for the multiple treatments, and it requires 10 or more treatments, across a couple of months.  I sent you a lengthy post. No links in it, with loads of helpful suggestions. yet, for some reason, even though I have been a member of this forum for weeks now, and no links were in the post, it still got routed to the moderator. Can someone explain why this is the case? Hi Lori THere are 2 or 3 different types of surgery which they employ for stenosis. Mostly they are concerned with stabilising the vertebrae with fixings whioch ultimately restrict movement. There's no guarantee of pain relief because there's no way of predicting how the neck will react post-surgery. I believe, but I could be wrong, that a 50% to 70% success rate is claimed. However, sometimes the beneficial effects are only temporary, and the same issues can start reappearing within a year. I was offered surgery , but I declined because of the unpredictability. However, that option is still available if needed (open appointment at Neuro Hosp ). I have found that the C/S condition changes itself, and sometimes symptoms improve, but again, that's also unpredictable. Perhaps something to bear in mind is that surgery cannot be undone, so whatever the outcome, that must be managed. My choice has been to stick with the symptoms I'm used to rather than take a chance on new symptoms appearing, but it's different for everyone , and it's a difficult decision to have to make. One thing I was particularly aware of was that I didn't want to resent having made a bad decision.if surgical outcomes were not favourable. hi Lori, I too have the same thing as you and I too am a member of the closed facebook group Cervical Spondylosis Support Site, it's been a godsend, good luck hunny x yes Gerry I'm in agreement I think I'd rather try and manage what I have rather than have surgery and make matters worse...."

          "Hi all. I'm new to all this so please bear with me. I've recently been diagnosed with cervical stenosis with intermittant radiculopathy. I've seen a neurological surgeon who said if they operate it would deal with the tingling in my arm but not the pain in my neck, shoulder, arm and back. The pain is my main problem as its really affecting my life. He seemed to give very little solution to the pain. I'm on gabapentin, amiteiptaline, cocodamol etc but these are having little effe t. Does anyone know if surgery could cure the pain? If there is a cure I would rather look into it than continuing in pain and on pills that aren't working. Any feedback would be hugely appreciated as I'm at a loss as what to do.next Thanks Lori x"

          " Hi Lou I can TKR with an extensive synovectomy and some other stuff 14 weeks ago with an epidural (spinal blockage) and sedation. It worked well and also provided extra painkiller in my leg for some time afterwards. I was up and out of bed 24 hours later as is the norm. Positive experience here. Good luck with your op. MM x  Hi, I had mine with a spinal and sedation and I was also very worried and almost cancelled because of it. But, the spinal was very easily done and the sedation felt like a general. I woke up thinking they'd put me under. It took a good 12 hrs for the feeling to come back into both my legs which was strange. A lot longer than a previous epidural I'd had. It's not as bad as it sounds and you'll be fine. Be brave and good luck Julia x I think most people have the spinal block now. I had my op 17 weeks ago and had spinal with a bit of general just to knock me out. I was told by my consultant that he didn't want me conscious as my op would be longer and much trickier than a normal TKR...it lasted 4 hours so I'm glad I listened. Recovery was brilliant, I felt fine as soon as I woke. Nothing to worry about, all you'll feel is a bit of pressure on the spine and a little trickle as it goes in x Hi Lou, Please don't be nervous of this procedure, it is fantastic and has a much quicker recovery time. I was so afraid when this procedure was suggested to me and almost made myself ill worrying about it. When the anaesthetist came to my room to finalise details with me just prior to my op, I confided my worst fears with him, he assured me that I had nothing to worry about and that I would be given a sedative along with the spinal block. They took me into the little room adjacent to the theatre and I sat on the edge of the bed whilst they checked my back, he then told me that after a tiny prick (which I didn't even feel) my legs would begin to feel quite heavy. I remember starting to feel this and then knew nothing more until I was back in recovery room, and very shortly after taken to my bed and given a light meal. I just couldn't believe I had just come through a major op and felt so well. It took a few hours for the numb feeling in my legs to wear off and was so pleased I had gone ahead with the spinal block and sedation. Hope this eases your worries. Dorothy It seems to by country. In the US it is almost exclusive general. I don't know anyone in my area that has had a spinal. Moist are using the femoral wire for pain relief Just before surgery they insert a wire in the femoral artery and start a drip that numbs the leg and then it's hooked to a self serve pump for extra distribution. Thats left in 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime they start on the or a l meds so you don't have the massive escalation in pain. I go to a medical school and the surgeon is an associate professor and instructor. He always has 2 or3 residents trailing him as does the anestheology professor.  Hi everyone, I have had 3 TKR in last 18 months and so a 4th. I have always had a spinal block and it is great ,no after effects of ikky feeling dont be nervous. you will be fine just have them sedate you before you go into room and see the tools the use. in last surgery i was still up when igot into OR i asked if they just left Home Depot you will be just fine Spinal and sedation definitely the way to do it. I was a little nervous on the way to the theatre but it was absolutely fine and I have no knowledge of the actual op. Hello Lou don't be worried. They will do a spinal tap, but you won't know anything about it. They give you a sedative before that and you will knocked out. They do spinal tap, I was told because we have involuntary movement of our limbs during surgery sometimes and they do not take a chance of your leg moving at the wrong time and mess up stuff. Hi Lou I am in Chicago 8 weeks post op on right and 2 weeks post op on left I had the spinal and a light sedative Felt nothing first op heard everything and was even asking questions not realizing where u was at second op was out didn't hear a thing Woke up from both not feeling my legs for a couple of hours After the pain med was available thru the IV Have to say this is the way to go Never regretted getting TKR can see the improvement although little each day Looking forward to the day when I can finally ride my bike with my husband after years of dust collecting on it Maybe I will get a new bike to celebrate? Good luck to you  Good luck on your surgery.i had it done in Dec. same as you, I was sick about it. It was wonderful and will do it for the 2nd one soon. "
