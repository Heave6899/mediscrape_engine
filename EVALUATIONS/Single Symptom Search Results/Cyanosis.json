          " I am in a similar situation to you Suzanne. My injury dates from 2002 (left foot) and only in January this year was CRPS diagnosed. Last year I found out I had spina bifida related spine problems and the nature of the pain makes me suspect the CRPS has spread. Basically the diagnosis is clinical- a physical examination comparing the affected limb to the normal and running through the Budapest Criteria for clinical examination. The medic should also look at a differential diagnosis- such as Paget's disease if you are diabetic. I was fortunate (?) that I also have changes to the bones in the foot and that the patchy osteopenia and bone marrow oedema are classic signs of CRPS. However, I still find specialists put \"CRPS (?)\" or \"possible RSD \" or \"painful neuropathy\" in letters and reports so the situation regarding an affirmed diagnosis is still poor in the UK. I have had to do a lot of my own research so I am an expert patient. The one thing I have found really difficult to do is explaining the nature of CRPS pain (without seeming like a hypochondriac) as no-one has a clue unless they also have CRPS- I have yet to meet another person living long-term with this condition. Sometimes I find a bit of empathy is a boost but pity makes me very uncomfortable. I've just joined patient.info as it was recommended from a Facebook user on a CRPS group (that I joined when I got diagnosed in August 2013). I too broke my left ankle in 2002 (Sept). However I have been living a pain free life having never heard of CRPS until July this year when my left ankle became very swollen and painful after I'd been out for the day in hot weather wearing new wedges. After seeing 3 different doctors over the following 8 weeks the 3rd doctor immediately came up with the diagnosis as he was a specialist at the local hospital for years prior to joining the GP's. I agree with you Karen in that its hard to explain  hi im new on here and have been suffering for the last six yrs to be finally told i have crps an physical depression but my specailist has just informed me that she will only be seeing me every six mnths and im still on the waiting list for a psychiatarist i know how you feel its so annoying not being heard an moved alone like it dont matter i have problems walking due to the pain an very rarely sleep but all i can recomend is lots of feel gd films it may not last long its better then waiting to be told take these tablets an go away xxx lol  hello michelle . i am sorry that you have got CRPS and Depression. which specialist is this ? ( is it Pain Management )  i have been suffering with crps with vascular complications since march 2007 after my legs were crushed. it took over 5 yrs for my doctors to fully diagnose the symptoms, this is a very difficult condition to live with. in 2011 i had a neuropathic stimulator fitted. the device is fitted internally and wired to the nerve ganglions in the lower spine, with the support of a vast amount of medication it has improved my mobility. but i have resigned myself to a life of constant intense pain. on a more positive note to have a diagnosis does make me feel less insane!!  what is your medication ? kind regards - richard007  pregabalin, tramadol & paracetamol at present. tramadol should be replaced with ketamin as better at at controlling pain with smaller doses.  Hello nicholas90480, I'm in the exact same boat as you are. My legs were crushed by a forklift about a year ago. Now the doctors seem to be looking into CRPS. My last doctor referred me to a pain specialist who gave me Gabapentin and now wants to do a nerve block in my spine. From what I've been vastly researching, these pain blocks on the spine don't work and usually end up making people worse and could potentially be very dangerous causing more permanent damage. I don't think I can allow this doctor to do this procedure. I'm in such a rut because I can't take any more pain and I sure don't want to be somebody's Guinea Pig so they can make about $6,000 bucks profit a shot \"just to see how I react\". They haven't even been approved in the U.S. for diagnosing or treating CRPS. For what? Especially when the shot is only temporary relief, only for the very view. Why do people like you get these implants and keep them in if they don't work? I understand the desperation some may feel like I feel myself and sometimes I say to myself I'll do anything to stop this pain including putting a gun to my head but you've got to be good to yourself first and always do anything to make yourself feel better. Did this implant really improve your mobility or does it help you psychologically knowing that it's there to help you move along. I'm having such a hard time accepting this being told I would have to be in pain management the rest of my life. I've researched what these drugs do to people long term and it's never good. What helps me just a little is to stay warm, massage, keep moving my joints without force, and a strict diet. But then within 10-20min. symptoms right back. Constantly back and forth. Sometimes it's hard to breath. How do you cope? If I didn't have a wife and 2 kids I would of probably ended it by now. hi i have been see my pain consultant , who has told me that i will not get better. "

I have had symptoms of pain, oedema (ankle) and cyanosis (foot) and in my left leg/groin/back follow lifting equipment at work in 2010. The pain has never resolved and I'm now medically retired due to the problems as I can only walk very short distances and I limp all the time. I presently take Pregabalin 100mgs 3 times a day and amitriptyline 30mgs at night, I also add in paracetamol and codeine as needed. I used to use TENS but I now use a pain pen as needed.

          " honestly it's completely safe when you are pregnant x I know soooooo many people who have taken it while pregnant and baby is fine x if its helping it's best you keep taking them because your mental health is just as important for the baby \ud83d\ude0a I'm a man so this is not my personal experience \ud83d\ude05 hopefully someone will come along soon that will be able to reassure you. some gps will suggest you come off but there really is no need  i am currently 33 weeks pregnant and been on 10mg my whole pregnancy and since before i got pregnant. My doctor agreed it was better i stay on them  i was on 10mg citalopram all through my second pregnancy and everything was absolutely fine. Both my gp and maternity doctor explained that it was such a low dose and safe. much safer than the effects of coming off them so dont let anyone bully you. talk to your doctor for reassurance. Congratulations too!!  ignore the person in your comments that's freaking out. there is always one. lack of research and ignorance will do that to people. it's safe to take this medication particularly at such a low dose while pregnant. like research suggests that there can be way more harm done to the baby from untreated mental health than the medication. take the tablet and relax your baby will be healthy just like many babies that were in the same situation as yours. there are risk with every medication its normal to be worried.  Here is the full text re: use in pregnancy and its related dangers. Sorry if others don't agree with me. Please READ IT. Neonates, pregnancy There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; citalopram should be used in pregnancy only when the benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risk to the fetus. There is some evidence that SSRI use may cause non-teratogenic fetal harm during human pregnancy. Neonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Symptoms have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of serotonergic agents or, possibly, a neonatal abstinence syndrome. Epidemiologic reports also suggest a possible association between maternal use of SSRIs after 20 weeks gestation and the development of persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) of the newborn. More recent retrospective studies have not shown an increased risk of PPHN with SSRI exposure. In December 2011, the FDA issued a safety announcement stating that based on conflicting data an increased risk of PPHN from SSRI exposure cannot be determined, and that healthcare professionals should not alter their current practice of treating depression in pregnancy at this time. Women who are pregnant, or are planning a pregnancy, and currently taking citalopram should consult with their physician about whether to continue taking it. When treating a pregnant woman with an SSRI or other serotonergic agent during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. If clinically feasible, gradual tapering of the medication prior to delivery may be considered. A prospective study of pregnant women receiving antidepressant treatment found that only 26% of those maintained on their antidepressant had relapsed versus 68% of those who had discontinued their medication. Increasing evidence suggests an association between antidepressant use during pregnancy and a subsequent diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the offspring. In 2 separate population based case-control studies, an approximate 2-fold increased risk of autism spectrum disorder was observed. One study found the increased risk was associated only with SSRI use, while the other study found an increased risk associated with use of SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants. In animal studies, citalopram has been shown to have adverse effects on embryo/fetal and postnatal development, including teratogenic effects, when administered at doses greater than human maximum therapeutic doses. In general, animal studies have shown that SSRIs downregulate the serotonin receptors in the fetal cortex and that these changes can be present for a period of time after birth. The effect of citalopram on labor and delivery is unknown. The National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications is dedicated to evaluating the safety of psychiatric medications that may be taken by women during pregnancy to treat a wide range of mood, anxiety, or psychiatric disorders. The primary goal of this Registry is to determine the frequency of major malformations, such as heart defects, cleft lip, or neural tube defects, in babies exposed to various psychiatric drugs during pregnancy. While the research concentrates on atypical antipsychotics and antidepressant use, pregnant women using other psychiatric medications are encouraged to register. **Moderator comment: I have removed the link(s) directing to site(s) unsuitable for inclusion in the forums. If users want this information please use the Private Message service to request the details.** I really appreciate all of the positive advice. As we all know living with anxiety is a struggle enough as it is, I don't need to be thinking negatively while growing a baby. I have reached out to my family doctor, I have an appointment next Friday (6 weeks), they have advised me to KEEP TAKING cit as I am on such a low dosage, if any problems arise down the road they will modify it then. I was not asking in lieu of going to my doctor, I was just looking for comfort in knowing someone else has been through this! Again, thank you all for your kind words. and jo94743 in future please don't scare other pregnant women! Suggest going to a DR asap and leave it at that, its not that I was \"hearing what I want to hear\" I was hearing from other women in the same situation I'm currently in. Thank you though. "

          " Do you or have you ever smoked in your life? Which Antbx did the Doc put you on? are they resistent you may need a stronger one! ..Have you done a Sputum sample if you are still getting excessive mucous? Is ther pain in your chest when breathing? some of these things may help with a diagnosis... I would advise asking for a diagnosis... could be Bronchitis Pluerisy (wet). Are your lips or Finger nails Blue (cyanosis) sign of something perhaps more serious.. Pneumonia is dangerous for over 60's you may requre a Flu Jam for both conditions, ask your Doctor. A second opinion by another GP may not be a bad idea. List all the problems you are having for him. Have to say I agree with the other comments either go back to your GP or get a second opinion ,. i have to say last year I was much the same as you ,after a fall in January where I smashed my hand and had to have it pinned ,I had repeated chest infections and a number of cocktails of antibiotics etc, I had trouble coughing up the mucus and finaly was given a devise called a flutter devise ,which makes it easier ,then 2 weeks of Doxycycline and a course of steroids ,that seemed to do the trick ,,,,but it was ALL YEAR LONG that I was I'll on and off ,,,,the green phlegm is a sign of a chest infection ,take a sample to the GP and he will send it away to find out which infection you have got and which antibiotic will clear it ,best wishes . Physiotherapist may be able to help you with getting the flutter divice.. or the Doctor. Depends where you are from in NHS England.. may help disperse the sticky mucous. Its a case of trying the best Antibiotic, first step get a sputum test. Have the Flu jab http://www.nhs.uk/news/2008/08August/Pages/Flujabandpneumonia.aspx Hi Barbra: My advice is to go see a good pulmonolgist. Have them do a cat scan and sputum sample. You could have Bronchiectasis which is a widening in the airways of your lungs and you can't get rid of sputum like people with normal lungs. I do have it and it makes you cough a lot. It also leaves your lungs open to other infections and bugs. Get checked out by a good pulmonary Dr. Who knows what he or she is doing. I would be glad to talk with you if you would like. Good luck to you."

          "Hi, for the past 12+ months, I have had a really bad chest. So bad, that, since January, I have had 6 chest infections. The only time I actually felt 100%, was when my GP gave me 2 lots of Anti Bs, and Steroids. Then, 4 weeks later, I'm back to how I was! I have been to my GP and asked to be checked for Asthma, that was clear, but they didn't test me in my inhalation of air. I wheeze constantly and have a very bad hacking 'wet' cough. When I start coughing, my chest hurts. I sound like a very heavy smoker. (I'm a non smoker) at night, my breathing 'whistles' and in the morning, I have green phlegm on the roof of my mouth from front to back. I am considering going to see a different GP, who is retired, but has a Surgery twice a week. I feel that as he is 'old school' something might get done. Has anyone else had anything similair?"

          " Not sure how the US system works. But a CT scan should give your doctor an idea of the severity of the disease together with your symptoms. You need a good chest specialist who has a special interest in bronchiectasis. Treatment consists of daily Chest physio exercises and the appropriate antibiotic in high dosage when necessary. In the UK you would usually be managed by seeing a hospital specialist every 6 months or so and your General Practitioner in between. Ideally you would be taught the physio exercises at diagnosis and your sputum tested to see what your standby antibiotic should be. It is not as bad as it seems and can be managed if you get sufficient support from your medical carers. Glad you are sounding more positive. There are certain rare conditions that need to be excluded with blood tests so I guess that is happening now. Good luck with it all... Hi Mary Ann, I'm really sorry to read that you are yet another sufferer of the awful disease. First of all, Bronch is a VERY serious illness and anyone who tells you otherwise is totally ill-informed. The fact that you are fifty eight tells me that you have had the disease for a long time probably as a result of a childhood illness like measles or pneumonia. Bronch was once seen as an 'orphan' disease ie., lost in the mists of time and probably misdiagnosed. Fortunately doctors are finding out that far from it being obscure or outdated, it is much more prevalent in the general population than perviously thought. This new approach is encouraging new research and new treatments. When you think about it, your lungs are damaged and there is lots of puss and other things lurking usually in the base of them so it is no surprise that you are feeling tired and quite unwell. The suggestion in the absence of further investigation that you have sleep apnea is ridiculous. I'd take what this woman says with a pinch of salt in future and you should limit your contact with her apart from bloods and minor tests. You pay for your treatment in the US so there is no need to put up with misdiagonosis or shoddy treatment. At your age, it is virtually certain that your bronch is not caused by CF, you'd have been considerably more ill over the years and to be frank, living to 48 would be quite an achievement! I suspect the very humid climate in Florida will not be helping things so I would make sure the aircon is switched on and the dehumidifier settings on high. Please take care of yourself and know that you are not alone. Oh does anyone also have issues with hoase voice? I sound like a frog to me and if I talk alot I start to lose my voice. the two weeks i was on antibiotics voice was okay but since the 14days the hoaseness seems to be getting worse. Yep! After a night of bad coughing I sound like a duck.  Interesting appointment. Bronch specialist believes all my coughing is due to sinus issues and not bronchiectasis because it is a dry cough and I am not coughing anything up and have had no lung infections. However I am suppose to get ahold of my lung CT from April 2013 (even though I was told not to bring anything older than 6months when I made the appointment) and bring it at my next appointment in 6 months - March 2015. However he does want me to see their Ear,Nose and Throat doctor (ENT). So I guess I will be traveling to doctor again. In the meantime I have a stronger inhaler, stay on the two nasal sprays and omeprazole. At least I was told I should feel better in 6 weeks. I hope so because 6 weeks will be November which means I will have coughed most of the year for \"nasal drip\" p*ss poor medical care!!!! Not very confident in medical folks in my hometown right now! But very thankful I found this site for next year's appointment and if even these doctors are wrong too! I have had this disease for over 40 yrs and now my voice is gradually getting softer so that I think I am talking loud enough but people tell me to speak up. Does anyone else have this problem Hi. I was diagnosed 3 years ago and was as good as told to go away as it is \"hardly there\". I have looked on websites and am also confused as some of the symptoms i experience (pale skin, and cyanosis) are given as moderate, yet i am only just starting to retain mucuc. Hi Mary Ann. I had a simply sweat test to see if I had cystic fibrosis thankfully came back clear, I have bronchiectasis and have had it for over 60 years, i had a right lung lobectomy when I was 7 but it didn't stop it from spreading.your hoarseness may be due to acid reflux, the acid could also be causing your lung infections, something to look into. Not all doctors have the answers and I have found these forums helpful and self help also. I hope your beginning to feel better now.  Hi get on the Internet and find the best consultant that knows about bronc. Travel if you have to and make sure he/she has your scans. Any good consultant will tell you where you have it in your lungs and how bad it is. I was diagnosed with it ten years ago in the UK when I had two bouts of flue. I took no notice of diagnosis and didnt have a problem for 5 years when it flared up. I was given more scans and a different consultant said there was nothing wrong with me. Paid to see top man at royal brompton hospital and he confirmed the size and position of the damage on wvery scan I ever had!! You have to see the best consultant you can. They should offer you advice and Physio which you need to do regularly and energy antibiotics and then apart from staying away from people with infections, dust and smoke you carry on living your life. Good luck. "

Went doctor he told me hospital missed it 16 months ago on a CT scan and that it was not life threatening. Everything else I have learned has been here. Called doctor's office about the fatigue and nurse said I most likely have sleep apnea. Don't see doctor until December. Then I read here that fatigue is a common symptom. So why didn't doctor's office know this?? I am beginning to think I need to find a new one and I haven't even seen him twice. Have so many questions but don't know who to ask and/or who to trust. How do you know if it is cystic fibrosis or non cystic fibrosis? Did they check babies 48 years ago? He didn't order any tests or another CT see if it was worse or same? So how do you know how to treat? Very depressing and frustrating.:( Thanks for any input/help/advise/support! Mary Ann"

          " <p>Hi, I don&#39;t have a PFO, which by the way is not technically a &quot;hole in the heart&quot;, but rather a valve that dosen&#39;t close as it should after birth. &#160;I &#160;have an ASD, which is not</p><p>a valve, but an actural hole in the septium that separates the left and right atria. &#160;Both of these conditions have the propensity for throbus formation that can cause serious consequences, therefore a patient is oftentimes put on a blood thinner to reduce their risks. &#160;I was on a blood &#160;(warfarin) thinner for a period of time, but other health issues forced me to be taken off that drug. &#160;I take aspirin now, have</p><p>been taking it for a number of years, and have had no issues with thrombus formation. &#160;I have an autoimmune disease as well as pulmonary hypertension, reflux , but thankfully, no migraines. &#160;I wish you good health.</p> <p>Hi brenwag68,</p><p></p><p>I can&#39;t believe you have to wait that long to see a doctor, do you live in a small town?I live about 60 miles from NYC, and I can usually get an appointment pretty quickly, especially if my primary &quot;steps in&quot;. &#160;It&#39;s called professional courtesy, I&#39;m&#160;</p><p>sure you&#39;ve heard that before. &#160;One phone call from my primary, and I have an</p><p>appointment the next day, I call that a great outcome, and a fast response time.</p><p>Yes, you can &quot;shoot a clot&quot; with PFO&#39;s and even with ASDs. &#160;But with ASDs, which</p><p>are true birth defects, whereas PFO&#39;s are not really a birth defect, because it&#39;s&#160;</p><p>simply a valve that fails to shut after birth, thus the foramen ovale remains open.</p><p>I&#39;ve met people who went on blood thinners and some have even had these valves</p><p>shut through a procedure. &#160;Atrial septal defects, on the other hand, occur in early</p><p>fetal development, where heart tissue fails to develop in the septum leaving a hole.</p><p>Some people go through life never knowing they even have one. &#160;When they impact your childhood (failure to thrive) as mine did, you have reasonable height, but your weight is never commensurate with your height as it should be. &#160;At nine</p><p>years of age I weighed what my 5 year old granddaughter weighs, 45 lbs. A good</p><p>weight for a 5 year old, but not for a nine year old. &#160;I wasn&#39;t really low birth weight</p><p>either, considering I was a month early. &#160;I weighed 6lbs 5ouces, but after a year,</p><p>I started to look thin. &#160;Surgeries for these defects were in their infancy when I was</p><p>born, and a lot of the early surgeries didn&#39;t have good outcomes. &#160;Considering that</p><p>90% of all people with uncorrected ASDs are dead by 60 (usually as a result of heart failure) I feel lucky to still be alive at 64. &#160;Some of the remaining 10% have&#160;</p><p>even lived well into their 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s, but that&#39;s usually because they never had&#160;</p><p>a serious one in the first place. &#160;My mother, who is 90 is one such person, her ejection fraction is somewhat better than mine, which probably means her ASD</p><p>is not as serious, otherwise she wouldn&#39;t have made it this far. &#160;My sister who is</p><p>65 was always healthier looking than me, however she has had a bluish tinge to</p><p>her lips the last few times I&#39;ve seen her. &#160;She flies up to NJ every winter for a visit.</p><p>I&#39;m sure she has one as well, but the cyanosis concerns me, because she never</p><p>had failure to thrive. &#160;The most serious consequence with ASDs is, when the</p><p>shunt (direction the blood is flowing) reverses itself and becomes right to left, in</p><p>stead of left to right, &#160;I&#39;m banking mine is still left to right, otherwise I may not be</p><p>a candidate for correction. &#160;When these shunts become right to left, such as is the</p><p>case with PFO&#39;s, then there is a great risk for embolus to the brain, causing a stroke. &#160;I was on blood thinners over 20 years ago, but for a different reason; I was</p><p>experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is also associated with ASDs. &#160;I don&#39;t like the</p><p>idea of blood thinners &#160;if you were to fall and hit your noggin, you could bleed to&#160;</p><p>death, before an ambulance could get to you. &#160;I take 1 baby aspirin every day, that&#39;s it. &#160;I certainly hope you get in to see a doctor soon, do let me know how you make out. &#160;Take care</p>"

          " Morning Katy First off! You bloody stupid woman! How could you do that to your children? They haven't hurt you - he has!!!!! Now the telling off is over - get to your local A&amp;E and get checked out! You go and get checked out for you kids sake - they need you! Do you want my home numbver so you can ring me? Melbi xxx Citalopram overdose Fatal dose not known. Patients have survived ingestion of up to 2 g citalopram. The effects will be potentiated by alcohol taken at the same time. Potential interaction with tricyclic antidepressants and MAOIs. Symptoms Nausea, vomiting, sweating, tachycardia, drowsiness, coma, dystonia, convulsions, hyperventilation and hyperpyrexia have been reported. Cardiac features that have been observed include nodal rhythm, prolonged QT intervals and wide QRS complexes. Prolonged bradycardia with severe hypotension and syncope has also been reported. Rarely, features of the \\&quot;serotonin syndrome\\&quot; may occur in severe poisoning. This includes alteration of mental status, neuromuscular hyperactivity and autonomic instability. There may be hyperpyrexia and elevation of serum creatine kinase. Rhabdomyolysis is rare. Management Management should be symptomatic and supportive and include the maintenance of a clear airway and monitoring of cardiac and vital signs until stable. Consider oral activated charcoal in adults and children who have ingested more than 5 mg/kg body weight within 1 hour. Observe for a minimum of 4 hours due to long half life of citalopram. Control convulsions with intravenous diazepam if they are frequent or prolonged. An ECG should be taken. Found this and sounds like you will be okay Katy - but we aren't doctors so please go and get checked out..... Citalopram hydrobromide has a wide margin of safety in overdose. Cases of overdoses involved the ingestion of citalopram either alone or in combination with other drugs and/or alcohol. In clinical trials, with overdoses of citalopram ranging from 180 mg to 2000 mg, all patients recovered. One patient, ingesting over 1500 mg citalopram, had reversible ECG abnormalities, the most important of which was prolongation of QTc. Of the cases reported postmarketing, six were fatal. The doses of citalopram in these patients ranged from 840 mg to 1960 mg. All but one of these patients had concomitant drugs and/or alcohol. Serum levels of citalopram in patients who ingested 2000 mg, 4000 mg and 5200 mg of the drug were 2900 ng/mL, 3800 ng/mL and 10,040 ng/mL citalopram, respectively. All these patients recovered. Three fatal cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients who took overdoses of moclobemide (Manerix) and citalopram. The plasma concentrations of moclobemide were between 16 and 90 mg/L (therapeutic range: 1 to 3 mg/L) and those of citalopram between 0.3 and 1.7 mg (therapeutic concentration: 0.3 mg/L). This indicates that a relatively low dose of citalopram, given with an overdose of moclobemide represents a serious risk for the patient. Symptoms most often accompanying citalopram overdose included dizziness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, tremor, and somnolence. In more rare cases, observed symptoms included confusion, loss of consciousness, convulsions, coma, sinus tachycardia, cyanosis, hyperventilation and rhabdomyolysis. Thank you Melbi, yes, you are right...bloody stupid cow, thank god i stopprd when i did. Hmmmm, not quite with it, but think Ill just stay in and lie on couch watching kiddies films, make sure i go to bed early, so he cant throw his insensitive accusations. I cant go to A and E , hes working at 3pm, so Ill just have lots of water instead!! How did last night go, was it okay? :roll: :cry: I cant go, hes working!!! hi katy,hope your ok today...dont let ur man get to u.there not worth it!u have got to think of u and ur kids.wil keep trying the chat room.keep missing you!Take care.xx melbi..good for you girl.glad you got it sorted last night..(dirty stop out :twisted: )..just jealous!! good on u.kim.xx :shock: Melbi.did you? :lol: LOLOLOL did I what? :shock: How are you feeling now? Melbi xxx Morning Katy How are feeling today? Any yukky side effects from the 90 mg you took? Hope you are feeling better. Love Melbi xxx Hi Melbi, thanks for asking!!! how are you? Oddly, strange, but I feel better than ever.........though this house /flat is still a dump/a mess........and grrrrrrrrrr! Its getting to me, but apart from that I am good, becca is running about pretending shes snow White....and I am thinking .....wow! You are so special.........a complete raskel though, but still little, cheeky and hilarious..............the older one is busy pretending to be grown up, .....Get this melbi, she even tried to make her bed this morning......Pfff! made me chuckle, cause what a mess!!! But I loved it. So I am good. how are you? Have your barin zaps stopped yet? Awww Katy - bless you - you sound so much better today - here's hoping it continues for you :wink: Nah - the minute I try and walk around or do something other than lie fairly still - the brain goes off on one, they are making me feel really sickly now. Still, it is still far better (for me anyway) to suffer these than to be how I was while on the citalopram. At least I am feeling better in myself - stronger, more positive and more importantly of sane mind - which I most certainly didn't feel while taking them. Stupid doctor for giving me them in the first place - I am not impressed with her ability to sit there and write out such a prescription and give no thought of the consequences or affect they might have had on me - they did have on me and now having to go through all this to get myself back to how I was the day I went to see her about my insomnia. No - I won't ever be making another appointment with her and I will be voicing my disgruntled opinions of her when I see another doctor. Yes - I am feeling very bitter at the moment towards the medical profession - in future I will be the one that tells them what I need and what will help - not them scribbling on a piece of paper and showing me the door so they can scribble another prescription for the next person. Idiots! Keep your chin up Katy and enjoy your well being :D Melbi xxx LOL the above message does not contain a web address - if it does - I didn't add it lol :roll: Melbi xxx Katy If you feel that good after taking 90mg than maybe I should take a handful. It might help to pick me up. Feeling fed up today and can't get out of bed. :lol: What you been up to? I dont know kids are now pretending to be me, and I am pretending to be them. Easy peasy......trash the house, eat lots os sweets......then mummy can I have a cuddle? Pretend to be Snow White, watch some///really awful tv programmes, go to park, and then tea, bath and bed at 8 or maybe 9 depending on how lucky I am. get a story , a song, and sleep. What was that you said about side effects? Making my breakfast, and started to panic about CHRISTMAS!!! Huh, I know that years are flashing me by, but WAIT ....can I have summer first? Inside, i feel much happier! Asking children questions, \\&quot;Are you pair having fun?\\&quot; Okay must go, need to clean those raskels, they need a bath!!! Hope you are okay melbi, are you ? Mrs J - I have the perfect solution to your dilemma re: not able to get out of bed! Just go with the flow - resign yourself to the fact you need to stay in bed today and do it! End of! Katy aka Snow White - perhaps you need to speak with your doctor and ask if he/she will increase your dose? I'm fine as long as I don't move around too much :shock: They aren't anywhere near as bad as last night and are bearable - more a damn pain in the backside than unbearable! An inconvenience! They will pass and that is what I keep telling myself and until then I will (because I can) take things very easy. Melbi xxx"

          " Hi Susan Of course you are worried - but you will cope with this. You will manage the blue spells too - you will find your own way of dealing with the problems. We found it was better to keep him cooler - for example we didn't put his feet in the baby grow - he had lots of little sleeps - and fed little but often, just little hings like that really. Please read the nightmare of fallows on the experience page, this was about my grandson. Our grandson did not have really bad blue spells - sometimes he would just cry a lot and eventually would go a bit blue with crying so much. He would then just go to sleep with sheer exhaustion. I know how anxious you must be, as we were just the same. Be strong - you will get through it all - he will always be your special little boy. God bless you. :D Hi my daughter was born in April of 2007 also has TOF and AV canal, we are about to go for her complete repair next week. It has been a very up and down time, but we have been very fortunate to have had a very understanding and supportive medical team close by so that if I was ever worried or concerned a phone call or visit to our local PA unit was not a fuss. Yes I worry all the time but I found that if the medical staff are not concerned or don't look worried then I didn't. I have seen them move very quick when things have not gone according to plan and have positive outcomes. I wish you luck with your son.

It has been a very up and down time, but we have been very fortunate to have had a very understanding and supportive medical team close by so that if I was ever worried or concerned a phone call or visit to our local PA unit was not a fuss. Yes I worry all the time but I found that if the medical staff are not concerned or don't look worried then I didn't. I have seen them move very very quick when things have not gone according to plan and have positive outcomes. I have also found they really do get to know your child and do notice when things are not normal. I no the unknown is so so so hard, I have sometimes wish i had a crystal ball so i could see how things work out but really the only thing is to enjoy today, enjoy the smiles, hugs and kisses because they are really the only memories you want. I wish you luck with your son. Hi Susan, My son is now 9 years old ,but from the age of 4 weeks had tet spells. He would cry non-stop for about 2 hours at a time and always had a purple tinge to his skin. He was often floppy after a spell and his breayhing was shorter and shallower. From what I have been told by cardiologists, they prefer to hold of on doing full repairs on children under 12 months due to the fact that there hearts are so little, if necessary they will do a shunt first. Treat your child as normally as possible and just watch for colds etc. Good luck! :) THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO OFFERED ME ADVICE, IT WAS GREATLY APPRECIATED. MY SON IS NOW 11 MONTHS OLD AND IS' A LITTLE BUNDLE OF JOY. HE HAS NEVER HAD A \\&quot;BLUE SPELL\\&quot; THANK GOD AND IS ALREADY TRYING TO WALK! HE IS TO HAVE CORRECTIVE SURGERY WITHIN 4 MONTHS AT YORKHILL HOSPITAL IN GLASGOW, AND TO BE HONEST I COULDN'T WISH FOR A BETTER TEAM OF DOCTORS! I WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED ON HIS PROGRESS. THANKS AGAIN, SUSAN Hi Susan My son was born oct 05 he is coming up to 3 years of age now he is about to have the shunt taken out and the hole closed at alder hey childrens hospital as his dad i am scared but i no he will be ok as he looks like any normal boy things were hard at first when he was born we found out of his condition when 18 days old we have 4 boys in total 1 younger than my son who was born with no problems I hope everthing works out for you if you can get treated at alder hey i would highly recommend there as they are fantastic people Hi susan, I thought you may like to hear of my experience of this condition. My son was born with this condition plus a few variations, he was diagnosed at 2 days old, I sensed something was not right when is gave birth as he felt 'chesty' to me! he was my fourth child so i knew what to expect,. the midwife said it was just some mucus! anyway to cut a long story short. he was rushed to the royal brompton hospital at 2 days old for an echo cardiogram, I was so scared for him,. I was told he would have blue moments and he was seen at my local hospital by a heart surgeon from the brompton as well as a local paediatrician. His health was remarkably good. he was reviewed every 6 months. he required no medication at all and he went on to be a happy and healthy child., he had his first surgery at 13 years old and we were told that he may need it repeated in his 30's. He recovered well and grew into a lovely adult. He has just gone through his second op at 22 years as they said he had scar tissue that was causing problems. he is now recovering very well indeed and is hoping to go back to work in march! his op was in november. it is so surprising how well they recover. When they have blue moments you just sit with them and make them take deep breaths. my son only suffered these rarely. and mostly in the swimming pool because he got too cold . so i hope this is helpful to you, i know it is so worrying but time passes quickly and you must treasure each moment with your child. good luck for the future wishing your child good health throughout their life., god bless, julie Hi Susan , my daughter is 2 and half weeks old, was diagnosed 2 days old, she will be treated at Yorkhill, I just wanted to know about your experience. Thanks x Hi I was born with TOF and that was 43 years ago! Corrective surgery was so new then. I had my first operation at 6 weeks old, and several more over the years. I can imagine the question that are going around your mind. I'm sure your son will be fine, we have brilliant heart doctors and medical staff. If you have any questions please ask. "

          " Hi, I am 7 months pregnant with a little girl and she has been diagnosed with TOF. I recently see that you posted your story and I was hoping that maybe we could talk. Please reply back to the post! Thank you, Gretchen Hi Gretchen, would be great to speak to someone else going throught the same thing. I assume your baby was diagnosed at the 20 week scan? Do they have a treatment plan for her yet? Rachel Tetralogy of Fallot varies in it's severity. It sounds as though your son has a relatively mild form of the defect. I have two children living with tet. My daughter was diagnosed shortly after her birth and underwent three open heart surgeries with the first nine weeks of her life. She is now six years old. She has an internal pacemaker but is otherwise doing very well. She has had two more surgeries. Our second child is four and does not have the defect. We were told that there was only a small chance that we would have another child with tet so we tried for number three, hoping for a boy. We got the boy but he too has tetralogy of fallot. He is two years old and has had four open heart surgeries. He is now doing fine. If I could offer some advice, it would be to choose the hospital, cardiologist and surgeon after doing a great deal of research. My daughters surgeries were all done at San Diego Children's Hospital and the care was adequate. My son's first three surgeries were done at Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City. The surgeon did a very poor job. His lack of knowledge resulted in a long term health issue. I can not go into detail at this time. The best pediatric cardiac surgeon is Dr Hanley at Standford. I know that there are good surgeons at Boston Children's as well. It's also worth noting that I too have tetralogy of fallot. I am in my 30\\&quot;s and doing well. This is a genetic disease regardless of what your doctor may tell you. The long term prognosis is good and your child will most likely NOT have any physical restriction. I wish you and your child the best of luck, and please remember to look closely at your child's doctor and verify their experience and credentials in addressing the defect. Feel free to reply if you have any other questions that me or my wife may be able to answer for you. Hi, I've just read your story having re-visited this site after some time. I understand exactly how anxious you must feel, as we too had our baby boy diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot at just 1 day old !! After a stay in hospital when he was born (about 10 days) in June 2008, mainly for observations, he managed to stay really well. He fed well and grew along a normal growth pattern. The dreaded Tet Spells (Blue Spells) didn't really occur until he was about 10 months old. When they did occur they would happen around his lunchtime feed, and they'd last for about 2-5 mins. However after a cuddle with knees brought up to his chest, he would return to normal again - (thankfully) ! The good news is that Charlie had his surgery (Total Repair) in Alder Hey Children's Hospital in June this year, just a few weeks ago, and is doing really well. He was in hospital for a week, and was then able to come home. If your child is being treated at Alder Hey, then what I can say is he will be in really good hands as the Cardiac Team there are marvellous. We will be forever grateful to all the Doctors and Nurses who looked after Charlie during his stay with them. I hope this info is of some help to you. Please feel free to make contact if you would like to ask any questions. Stephen. Hi. My son was diagnosed with Fallots last September aged 10months.It was a complete and utter shock and we were all devestated.He had shown no signs of illness other than starting to get grumpy every now and then for no apparent reason. Within 8 weeks he has his first surgery - seven hours long at the Freeman - torture! He was in PICU for two days and then on the ward in isolation for a week but then home in time for Xmas. He has since had a cardiac catheterisation as his pulmonary arteries (branches) are still too narrow. This didn't work either so unfortunately we are now waiting for another open heart op to try to fix that! WHen his murmour was picked up at a routine Dr appointment - we thought nothing of it but I still feel shocked that he was living with SATS of 81% max (on full oxygen) and we didn't know. Anyway, it is very very scary and we cried for days (and still do now and then) but even the nurses in PICU said that out of all the Heart problems to have - this is a good one as it is more or less fixable and life expectancy is normal. I hope that the operation is soon for you as the waiting is the worst part. My son is a real little boy and certainly doesn't act like he has heart problems - I know a few Fallow's babies now and they are all doing really well. I can't stop you worrying but you know that you aren't alone - there are lots of us out here and any questions you have - I will try to help with. Stay positive - the surgeons are fantastic and it will all be behind you soon. x [color=blue:9fa2e13205][/color:9fa2e13205] As I read your stories I was overwhelmed and excited by the thought that there are several of us dealing with this condition. Well, my daughter is now 24 years old, just had her second open heart surgery at St. Joseph Hospital and I should say, we were all very pleased at the result. On March 17th, she had an angiogram and found that her pulmonary valve was leaking profusely. We were devastated and scared. 5 weeks later (her surgery was scheduled on June 16th), she's now almost back to her normal self. She lost 10 lbs, which was the only devastating fact since she was very little to begin with, but that was an expectation. Other than that, she does not need Cardiac Rehab. and tries to walk at least 30 minutes a day, in increments of 3x a day. This week, she went further than that. I tried to wean myself out of worrying and let her go on with her life. Her first surgery was when she was 15 months old in UCLA. Our goal was to have it done when she was 2 years old but could not wait since she was running us down. I have to quit working as she turned blue when she cried longer than a few minutes. She's so tiny and delicate that we did not trust anyone to watch her except her grandparents. That surgery was very successful that even her current cardiologist was amazed at the work Dr. Drinkwater did to her heart (she had a hole in the middle of the 4 chambers). By the way, we also just found out that she has a DiGeorge syndrome, a Q22.11 deletion (missing chromosomes) and carried some of the symptoms other than TOF. I would suggest that you should stay postive no matter what. Pray hard, and work with your doctors. Make sure that you understand everything, know what to do and research in the internet for anything that you do not understand. My daughter has two more semesters to go before she finishes her bachelors in Sociology/Gerontology in CalState Fullerton. I will be happy to be of a support to anyone out there.... God bless. I was diagnosed with a heart murmur at 3 days old. My parents were told to go home and keep an eye on me, and go to A&E if I stopped breathing or went blue. It sounds really crazy doesn't it? I'm 20 now. My mum went through the exact same thing. Always checking on me at night and stuff. You'll be more comfortable with it in time, just try to treat your child like any other, within reason. I have an ASD and a VSD among other things. I'm in a wheelchair but happy and independent. Obviously heart diseases vary a lot. It might interest you to know that American two time Olympic gold medalist snowboarder Shaun White has tetralogy of Fallot. So it does not mean that your child won't lead an almost normal life. Just try not to beat yourself up about it. It's just a bit of bad luck that this has happened. You'll feel better when you start to get your head around it. It's a massive thing to deal with but once it's been sorted out in your head, everything goes on as normal. If you fancy reading about someone else who has heart disease have a look at my blog :) everyone deals with illness differently but it might be helpful. www.thegirlwithheartdisease.blogspot.co.uk Hi I am to have my 5th surgery due to fallots An feeling very nervous any body else been threw same thing just need a ill advice xx"

          "Our son was diagnosed with Tetralogy of fallot 6 weeks ago at 3 and a half months after a trip to the GP with a bad cough and chest infection. We were sent to our local hospital from the GP surgery and then sent to Alder Hey the next day where he was diagnosed after a scan. He hasn't had any blue spells and feeds really well - he is a very good weight for his age. We came home from hospital after 2 weeks of monitoring and he is now on propranalol 3 times a day. He has been back to clinic since and they were pleased with him and hope to wait until he is 12 months before doing surgery. He will need to go back to clinic every 6-8 weeks. He also has a nurse visit at home every 2 weeks to check his SATS are ok and so far they have been fine. The thing is, even though the doctors are all pleased with him and happy for him to carry on at home - I just can't stop worrying about it. We have put him in his own room at night now and I feel so guilty! I lie awake wondering if he is ok and checking on him all the time. Every time he crys I worry thet he's having a spell or that he might turn blue. I was so happy when we came home from hospital but it's just hit me all of a sudden this week - I spent all day yesterday sobbing!!! I don't feel like I can talk to my parents as they are very emotional about the situation and i don't want to upset them and whenever I mention it to my husband he just says \\&quot;he will be fine\\&quot; but will he I wonder? I wish i was coping better for his sake because I just want him to be treated normally by everyone and enjoy being a normal baby. It would be good to hear from anyone going through the same thing or anyone who has been through this situation."

For example the last severe one I had, as I went to leave to go to the toilet I started feeling so cold my teeth were chattering and I was violently shivering. After a while, I looked at my hands which were paler than they usually were and my fingertips and fingers were starting to go white/blue (cyanosis). I have not seen this symptom with people who have costochondritis and was wondering if anybody experienced the same thing. It is not pneumonia, as I get this with my costo&#160;episodes.&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p>"

I have never had any problems before, but its killing my confidence now !!! I have been to the doctors several times - they gave my hydrocortisone which did not work, then something a bit more powerful, which again had no help, clindamycin (again no impact) and finally I just finished a course of floxacillin which has not done anything. A dermatologist could not help me either. I have put a pic here : pic.twitter.com/81cwJOHExe pic.twitter.com/TqQkWMmo0f Any advice on this would be much appreciated - thanks"
