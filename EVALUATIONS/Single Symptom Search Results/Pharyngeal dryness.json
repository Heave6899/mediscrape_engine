          " WOW, I have some of those symptoms for some time now and now the dry eyes the last month which is disturbing me alot. I don't have any of the typical GERD symptoms and medication is doing nothing for me. I did stop taking B Complex but I do have a new one I purchased (sublingual) so just as a preventive measure I'm going to take it daily again. I do eat lots of veggies and fruits. I don't eat red meat maybe once bi-weekly and a very small portion so maybe is time to eat read meat once weekly and take those B Complex sublinguals. Thanks for the information. ;-) Thanks Amy for sharing this info. I wonder where do you buy subligual co-enzyme , is it over the counter and what brand is good ? Hi, this is a really helpful thread. I have been diagnosed with lpr, the doctor looked at the back of my tongue with a microscope and said that the tonsils on my tongue are damaged. Is this also a sign of deficiencies ? I've been put on lanzoprazole and it's made my tongue feel swollen and the back of my mouth feel so dry and also makes me bloAted 24/7. Not too sure if it's done much for the other symptoms as I have a cold at the mo so got a sore throat anyway. I've decided to go on a low carb, low fat and low acid diet which is making me miserable. Anyone got any help they can give me? I'm a teacher too so shouting is also really bad for my voice box if it is lpr. "

          "I was initially diagnosed with LPR for my symptoms, which were constant post nasal drip, hoarse voice, and a click when I swallowed. I have since figured out it wasn't LPR at all, and that all the protocols for LPR only make things worse. I came here to hopefully help others who may have been told they have LPR when really, they have something else. The symptoms of LPR are exactly the same as the symptoms of nutritional deficiencies of B vitamins, vitamin A, and iron. In particular, a riboflavin deficiency will dry out the soft tissues of your throat so that you feel every tiny drip of what is actually normal mucus. Riboflavin is a B vitamin that is not stored in the body and you must eat it every day. Dairy products, something many of us with mucus are told to avoid, are very high in riboflavin, and one of the best sources. Stress, illness and certain chronic conditions can increase the body's requirements for riboflavin, causing deficiency symptoms, like a dry, post nasal drip in the throat. (In my case, I became deficient due to an undescovered thyroid issue. When the thyroid is not functioning properly, you do not metabolize riboflavin.) Mild riboflavin deficiency will also cause dry, itchy or burning feeling of the eyes. Other B vitamins which affect the throat are niacin and folate. Iron deficiency causes tongue and throat swelling and can even cause webbing of the esophagus. Vitamin A and zinc also affect the mouth, tongue and throat. Iodine is essential for the salivary glands. Certain health issues can affect the metabolism of nutrients. You can be deficient even though you get plenty of it in your diet. Your genetics, your diet, and your current health conditions all affect your nutrtitional status. Proton pump inhibitors and acid reducers can make things worse by reducing your absorption of nutrients. If you want to try some vitamins to see if they will help, start with the water soluble B vitamins. I recommend taking co-enzymated sublinguals which melt under your tongue, so that you don't have to worry about whether you are digesting and metabolizing them properly."

          " Hello Wendy. There is another thread just started, for \"fed-up\" - who has a later stage COPD. Maybe you could go over there as a few people are discussing this horrible innness ? Good Luck Wendy -- Jay Hi Wendy. Firstly well done on kicking the habit. You are NOW well on the way to improving your chances of a better life. Now the next stage is to Google COPD and show some of the best results to your B/F in order to convince him that your LIFE is at risk with any further inhalation of the irritants that are contained in Fags. If he isn't happy then that is sad for you as he will be a victim of your problem, but it will be a choice that he has. Now, you CAN continue albeit with an encumbered life, for many many years yet. most sufferers die WITH COPD - NOT from it. Sadly, you will need to greive the loss of your previous life and understand that many things that you took for granted will one day, not be there for you to enjoy but you are still young so nothing to stop you from getting the bike out or going to the Gym and pushing the boundaries as much as you can. The more you do whilst able the more you will be able to do when old(er). Research time will pay dividends so let google be a close companion for a while and remember that we are all very annoyed at being chosen. Big ((Hugs)) from me, anyway.xx  Hi Wendy,you were at the doctor and she didn't mention copd or emphysema so i hope you have a chest infection,you didn't say you were coughing up sputum,that is also a very good thing.Also you are only 40.I well understand the tears and I opened a forum today as I am also scared and very confused and you are right, the internet says one thing on one site and another on a different site.I hope you get good results and I don't think you have left things as long as I did.Either way I will be thinking of you and I wish you all the very best.Take care of yourselfresults and I don't think you have left things as long as I did so you may just have caught everything in time.Wish I went as early as you Dear Wendy. Good for you for quitting the ugly habit. I smoked for 37 yrs but gave it up 23 yrs ago if you are looking for some sage advice I would tell your partner he cannot smoke in the house. Second smoke will damage your lungs as if you were smoking. Also if you are looking for an exercise that will help your lungs start a swimming program. Believe me these two suggestions will help. If yourpartner won't smoke outside you may have another decision to make All the best, Mary Ann from new Westminster BC. Canada.  If you pack up smoking, and keep away from secondary smoking your emphysema will not get any worse, but once you have it it will not get any better either. Let us know how your x ray results go."

          "Hi there. I'm new here and i'd like a little bit of advice if at all possible. I gave up smoking at new year, just over two years ago. My dad died from emphysema when he has 60, and i always said that if i ever got a cough that reminded me of my dad i would quit. It got to the point where i was coughing myself to sleep each night, and i realised this wasn't just a cold that was going away, so i set myself a smoking deadline of new year (this was in the autumn) and did just that. Well 90% of my cough went away virtually overnight, but i was left with a niggly throat clearing thing, which wasn't too much hassle. Felt pretty good, and pleased with myself. So anyway, a couple of weeks ago i was doing a meditation app, and the instruction was to take a deep breath and hold it. It kind of took me by surprise, and the next day my back was hurting. So i made an appointment for the docs and she booked me in for a chest xray and prescribed me a peak flow meter and some ventolin. 3 times a day i have to do a best of 3 reading, take two puffs of ventolin, then twenty mins later do another best of 3 reading. After three days of doing so i'm feeling constantly breathless, worse than i ever did, i still have that pain in the left side of my back, and i am sure now that indeed i have emphysema like my dad. I feel like crying all the time yet i'm putting a brave face on for everyone. I don't have any kids, and my boyfriend still smokes in the house. I try not to be around it, bit it's only a small house and difficult to avoid. He didn't see the long horrible death my dad had, both his parents are still fit and healthy. My morning peak flow reading is 350 and the other two (noon and night) are roughly 370 with hardly any difference from the ventolin except i think its giving me a dry throat. I guess my question is, has anyone else had COPD from age 40 and still lived a long time? How bearable is it? Because my dad carried on smoking quite far into his (he gave up when he went on oxygen) i'm finding it hard to expect anything different than he got. Also is it possible for the peak flow tests to be making me breathless? Thankyou for any advice, i'm so down right now i just don't know what to do. I'm dreading the xray results, i should get them some time next week. I've read loads on the internet, and alot say it doesn't get too much worse if you quit, but then everyone on the forum's experiences suggest otherwise. I'm scared and confused, thank you in advance"

I&#39;ve been in and out of doctor&#39;s offices for the past month and I haven&#39;t been able to get any real clear answers either. And the stress is the worst!</p><p></p><p>I was diagnosed with GERD and a hiatal hernia a few years ago, which cause acid reflux, burping, and a burning sensation in the stomach, so perhaps you&#39;re having some of the same issues. It could also be gastritis or an ulcer because that&#39;s what the doctor&#39;s think I have right now- but I&#39;m also waiting on an endoscopy to find out for sure.</p><p></p><p>Honestly, trying to find something to distract yourself with is probably one of the best things you can do. I know it&#39;s hard, I find it especially hard when I&#39;m at work, but when I&#39;m home I&#39;ll watch my favorite tv shows or youtube channels, sometimes play video games and the distraction helps me not to think about being in pain or stress about worse possibilities so much.</p><p></p><p>I&#39;ve taken to sitting with a heating pad on my stomach lately too and that helps me relax a lot. The pain doesn&#39;t feel so severe.</p><p></p><p>As for food, I start off every day eating a banana which helps coat the throat and stomach. Oatmeal also helps with that. And I&#39;ve started drinking almond milk because it&#39;s less harsh on the stomach than regular milk. These things don&#39;t really stop the pain but they don&#39;t make it worse. I&#39;ve also been eating mostly chicken as a protein source because most other meats are too fatty and hard to digest. For snacks, I eat a lot of veggies. Carrots, celery, mushrooms, broccoli- they&#39;re all easy to digest and low acid.</p><p></p><p>I hope these things help you out and you start to feel better soon!</p>"

          "<p>hello there, I just wan to share my problem I&#39;ve been having burning pain in my upper stomach,I burped all the time,stomach is noisy everyday and most of all I have a terrible dry throat as well and dry throat is terrible at night and it make me wake up in the middle of the night and sometimes I feel like the food I&#39;m eating is just stocked in my stomach not been digested well even liquids like water.feels like my stomach is producing too much acid,and sometimes if I pressed my stomach feels like I can feel small lumps and sometime they hurt too..last month I went to the doctors and told her my symptoms she Said it&#39;s just acid and need to take gaviscon,after 10 days of gaviscon it didn&#39;t helped went to see the doctor again and she gave me landzoprazole coz she thought it&#39;s inflammation of stomach lining after 3 weeks of taking landzoprazole it still didn&#39;t helped me and one night I was rushed to the hospital because of severe stomach pain upper part.they did some blood test to check my liver,kidney and gallbladder but all came out normal.the doctor in the hospital suggested that I should have endoscopy coz he think the problem is in my stomach. I&#39;ve been stressed and scared for months now coz all I did was to spend days and hours in Google and it&#39;s just telling me I have a serious disease.So went back to my doctor who gave landzoprazole and told her I was rushed to the hospital and landzoprazole is not helping me either and that the doctor in the hospital said I need to have endoscopy.She changed landzoprazole to Ranitidine and she suggested I should have a stool exam first for H pylori, Again I Went to Google and read some things about H pylori and and it says one of the major cause of stomach cancer.this is stressing and making me scared even more coz I think I also have the symptoms of it.need to wait 2 weeks for my stool exam and a month for my endoscopy appointment,the waiting time is killing me ang making me stress even more. This dry throat I&#39;m feeling now is scaring me too coz I read as well that too much acid will damage your esophagus and may cause aesophageal cancer..It&#39;s all in my head now that I have serious illness.This been making me Cry and worried everyday for the last 2 months.I dont enjoy things anymore,sometimes I just want to be alone and don&#39;t want to talk to anybody.My husband did his best to lessen my worries but it&#39;s not helping me.I want my normal life again I just got married last March and just starting a family.But instead of being happy This things making me down and emotional everyday.Anybody with the same &#160;experience I will appreciate it if you tell me about your experience and how you coped up with it.</p>"

I am on 5mg per day.I have this itchy throat and cough some nights. I find however that taking the smallest sip of codene linctus helps a lot tastes disgusting but well worth it. Be careful though as if you take it too much it can become addictive. I only have the smallest sip nowhere near even 1/4 of a teaspoon, and not always every night. Hope this helps someone change your prescription,do not take no for an answer,Ramipril is cheap that's why its used ,you should have to accept side effects like that when there alternatives that do the job just as well. Hi, I found this page when looking for side effects of Rampiril. I have been on 1.25mg for about 8 months, and have had problems with a sore dry throat, and a cough. It got so bad that I couldn't sing properly, and that is my hobby. In the last few weeks I have developed an itchy burning rash all over my body. My doctor insists it can't be the Rampiril as it's taken this long to manifest. She told me to take a small break from it, and the itching and throat problems eased, but I felt so awful I satrted taking it again, and the symptoms have come back with a vengence! I am stopping taking Rampiril again, and going back to my doctor. This is not an acceptable side effect, and from what I am reading on this page, it can get much worse!  Hi. I have been taking Rampiril for about 2 years if not more, and have had an annoying cough for about the same length of time. I didn't know that it could be the Rampiril, but after reading these posts, am going to stop taking them, and ask my G.P. to check my blood pressure, and if I still need them, will ask for an alternative. No-one should have to put up the with side effects that I've read on here. it is your right to ask for an alternative medicine if you want it. I have been taking Rampiril for a few weeks I have gone from 2.5 mg to 10 mg in Three weeks. I have now developed a dry cough and have cold sores. I have also been taking Rampiril for about a year now and have suffered this constant, annoying tickly cough and dryness in my throat. My GP has dismissed my concerns as if they're just a figment of my imagination! In the last week I have, as a very expensive but desperate means of trying to rid myself of this condition, paid for a sessions of acupuncture, administered by a Chines practitioner. Within the first hour, with a herbal mixture rubbed onto my top lip, the cough ceased immediately. Over a week later, I am still free of what I believe to be the Rampiril generated cough which has severely debilitated my life for the past eighteen months. Why on earth can't the NHS in the UK recognise that their Western medicine can learn a great deal from alternative therapies and bring relief to their patients ? I used to take Ramipril but i had a bad reaction to it after a number of years.It is known to give the sort of side effects that you describe inc rashes doctors know of this but its a cheap BP pill that's why its promoted .I will never accept what the Doctor's say if i feel the pill is the problem.10mg is prescribed because a few years ago it was found that it has a benefit to ward off strokes but with the extra risk of side effects. always search on the net especially some of the american sites where there is a lot of information,then get the doctor to change the pill there are a lot of better ones out there"

          " Hi Linda Sorry you are suffering so much. PPI's are generally well tolerated (I have been on Omeprazole for 18 months with no effects at all). These should be out of your system by now. Do you have a hiatal hernia? If so this can cause some pretty horrid symptoms in addition to the reflux.  Thank you. I know that most people tolerat ppis well but a small percentage do not and i am one of them. I dont have a hiatal hernia -have had an endoscopy- and these symptoms only occurred after started taking ppis unless its a horrible coincidence and ther is something else wrong. It feels a bit like what chronic fatigue symdrome must be like. Linda, I cannot tolerate PPIs either so I feel for you. I did try H2 blockers for a month and a half with little to no help. I'm now trying the natural route and I think it might be working though I have to say it is too early to be sure. I'm taking 3 mg melatonin 2 hrs before bed and DGL licorice 2X per day 20 min or so before meals. There is peer reviewed research to support the melatonin. I'm not sure about the licorice, but an article from the NIH (U.S.) said that the licorice thins the mucus. So, this is what I'm trying now: Dr. Koufman's low acid diet and rules, the melatonin, the DGL licorice and Iceland alkaline water. We shall see. So far so good. If this really works like it seems to be doing, I'll be sure to let everyone know. Susan Hi Linda, If it's just acid reflux and not something else, eating spinach may help. It helped me. I eat it boiled with salt, pepper, little garlic, olive oil. Stick it in the microwave for 9-10 minutes. I like it well done and drink the broth. If you don't mind eating spinach, try it every day for a week and see if it makes a difference. For me, it stops acid reflux immediately. If it starts in the middle of night, I get up, microwave some spinach, eat it and 10 minutes later I'm sleeping like a baby. Hope it works for you. Hi Linda I had the same side effects as you with omeprazole. I had been taking a large dose for a few months which were not really curing my symptoms but I kept taking them thinking that they may take some time to be effective. At first I did not associate the shakyness, unsteadyness, spaced out feeling and palpitations with the drug. Eventually I had to go to A&E as the palpitations were so bad one night. Even then they were not associated with the PPI. It was only through exensive research myself that I made the link. It took some time (can't remember exactly how long but certainly a couple of months) for me to feel as though I had my mojo back and feel more normal again. I now take a small amount of Ranitidine and Gaviscon - and of course all the lifestyle stuff. I am not cured and LPR symptoms do fluctuate in severity but at least I now feel better. The side effects of the PPI were awful. I am wondering if there is also a hormonal link with LPR as my symptoms are worse at some times of the month with other factors remaining the same. Maybe to do with LES and UES relaxation?? I had an endoscopy and it just showed I had gastritis. No HH. I also sent off the peptest which was negative. So I don't really know what is causing my symptoms. I hope you start to feel better soon, good luck. Linda Thank you for that, t have now been off the ppi for 2 weeks having been on them for 6 weeks and i think the worst physical symptoms are diminishing but still feeling a bit wobbly and tired, the main problem now is my anxiety and depression which is really bad and this also seemed to increase when I was taking the ppis. I too taek a small amount of ranitidine at night only 75mg as I cannot tolerate higher doses of that either and gaviscon. I have got a weak oesophagus and stomach ( I am 66 ao monthly cycle not relevant ) and a faulty valve which is why the acid refluxes upwards- do you have that? That is the usual problem for people with constant reflux. My throat is sore all the time and I have difficulty sleeping but no real heartburn only slight chest pain and wheeziness. Praying the othe side effects will wear off. Perhaps I should have a peptest. I am being considered for the fondiplication op. but may not be able to have it because of my weak oesophagus. Hello Linda It took me some time to fell as though I had 'returned to normal' after stopping PPIs. Like you they made me anxious which is not like me - I am usually a calm, capable and optamistic person but I was losing my confidence and felt shaky (physically and mentally) most of the time. It was horrible so I can understand your situation - I do now feel back to normal from that respect so hope you continue to feel better given some more time. When I had my gastroscopy they said my valve was ok so I really don't know why I am having all the classic LPR symptoms. Having had to push for all the tests and pay for the Peptest myself I feel my GP is not really helpful as we have come to the stage where he has run out of solutions. That is why I am trying to live with it by taking the small amount of medication which I seem to be able to tollerate and all the advised lifestyle changes I have read about (diet, ph water, etc etc). My main distressing symptoms are a lump and tightness in the throat, hoarseness and pressure in my ears......some days bad and some days not so bad. Sounds as though you know what is causing your symptoms and that there may be a surgical solution. I hope you find this .............though it sounds as though it is not definite...........good luck and keep us posted. Linda  Has anyone been tested for leaky gut? Food sensitivities may be causing this too.... I was given PPI'S (Omeprazole one 20mg per day) only on them 10 days. They did not work for me, as I was still getting burning in chest. I started feeling week about that time. I did not put it down to the PPI. I have been off of these for over four months. My Dr changed me to Ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) and does the job for me, I find the Gavisgon tablets helpful too.I still feel as if I am geting over the flu, my legs feel week all the time. I thought this feeling was down to the GERD/GORD problem. I was a healthy 64 year old early last year. I went to the gym swam regular, till May, when I started to get what I thought was Hay fever. Non seasonal Rhinitis is what it was. Four months later, Asthma started (I have never smoked). GERD symptoms appeared shortly after the Asthma. I am really interested in all that has been posted about PPI'S causing the fatigue/tiredness. I also found I was for ever trying to clear my throat, but since cutting out Dairy and having Almond milk my throat feels clearer. Hi Linda I was given Omeprazole 20mg once a day for a month last year for dyspepsia. Didnt feel any adverse symptoms. Symptoms of dyspepsia came back together with a feeling of breathlessness, chest ache, dry throat and a feeling of a lump in my oesophagus. I was restarted on the Omeprazole and referred for an endoscopy. All tests came back normal. LES normal but I still had these symptoms. I also felt very anxious and at one point I felt a panic attack coming on. I am generally level headed and can rationalise things but I was obsessing about what was wrong with me seeing as everything came back normal. I felt jittery and on a knife edge but was told by the GP that perhaps stress has been causing all these symptoms. I stopped the Omeprazole after feeling much better and anxiety had settled. However, 3 days after stopping the symptoms in my chest reappeared so I started Omeprazole again. The same day I ended up with a panic attack! I am now at a quandry and have to weigh up whats causing more bother to me. The anxiety when I take Omeprazole or the chest aches, dry throat etc. The Omeprazole helps with my chest but I definitely feel jittery on them. I also don't want to start taking tablets as I am very healthy, run 3 or 4 times a week and am only 39. Thats a lot of years (hopefully) ahead of taking pills! I've been looking at acid reflux diets and I think I'm going to try this. I have a feeling Omeprazole is suppressing good acid and I will end up with more ailments if I continue this. Anyone have any suggestions of an Acid Reflux diet? I will try the Spinach option as I love it! Thanks x 3 mg Melatonin two hours before bed: I have been on the Koufman low acid diet and drinking alkaline water for a year which has been very helpful. Recently I added 3 mg melatonin two hours before bed to try to get a more complete cure for my LPR. This is based on real research. The gut produces melatonin and if you don't have enough, the valves are compromised. You can find the research on pubmed.org. The melatonin has helped quite a bit. I don't take any PPIs and take the H2 blockers only with treats that violate the Koufman diet like the occasional margarita (very acid). Has anyone else tried melatonin? Susan I had the same reaction to PPIs. H2 blockers like Rantindone do the same thing too. So if you are taking Rantindone its likey the problem. "

          " <p>I have had the lump in my throat sensantion for going on about 6 months now. I am only on the heavy side of a healthy weight and losing just 6 pounds has helped. I am hope to lose another 10 or so and feel that this will help greatly. I have read many posts here and so many people suffer with this. It is very frustrating. Doctor do not seem to help anyone with the lump sensation. It might be partly stress, but it&#39;s very real. I feel better after a glass of wine in the evening, but losing the weight as helped the most.&#160;</p> Your symptoms do indeed sound like extra-oesophageal reflux (commonly referred to as LPR) - see attached graphic. However there are no quick fixes (apart from surgery) . You need to control the reflux rather than the acid. Apart from making the reflux less damaging, anyacids and acid suppressants will do nothing to help. Go to the free book / website www DownWithAcid org uk and look at the chapter on extra-oesophageal reflux. To manage reflux, as you say, weight is the main thing. Also avoid over-filling your stomach by eating smaller portions but more frequently: 5 half-sized meals is better than three large portions. Avoid exercise after food - do it before you eat. Leave at least 3 hours between your last meal and going to bed. Raise the head of your bed by 6 to 8 inches on blocks. <p>Hi Sarah,</p><p></p><p>Sounds like you&#39;ve done a lot of your research, and doing well.</p><p>I had no idea what was wrong with me.

Some days it is really painful, some days only slight but this has been with me for about 18 months now. I get really down on bad days and this makes it even worse, I am trying to be very careful in what I eat and also doing my best to keep as calm as I can about everything in life. It would appear that this is the only way forward. Luckily I do not worry that this could be something more serious as others on this site do as that would only make it worse.</p><p>all the best to you</p><p>Robin</p> <p>Hi Sarah, I have suffered with your symptoms for a few years. Being in the UK and having free medical care, I had a gasoscapy and a camera up my nose ...which hurt. Also a swallowing test. They said I had a hiatus hernia and I was put on Es Omeprazol. Eventually it eased but I still have the post nasal drip and the burning from time to time. I take a muscle relaxant every night to relax the hiatus. There doesn&#39;t seem to be a total cure for this although losing weight seems to be the answer. I am also overweight but having MS, exersise is not an option.&#160;</p><p></p><p>I jope you you can get some relief. It horrible.&#160;</p><p></p><p>Best wishes.</p>"

          "<p>Hi everyone. I&#39;m brand new here. I have recently self-diagnosed myself with LPR and below is why.</p><p></p><p>My full-time job went out of business is September and therefore I lost my health insurance coverage. I have secured a new job (along with new insurance coverage) however I do not start until November 14. Hence why my condition is self-diagnosed.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few years I have dealt with bouts of heartburn/acid reflux but it was always fleeting. I&#39;d feel a slight twinge or burning and then it would go away. On the worst days, I&#39;d pop a few Tums and head to bed and then in the morning my symptoms were gone. Once in 2014 I had a particularly bad occurrence where I had a lump in my throat for just a couple days. The first day was awful and my manager actually had to bring me home from work. I wasn&#39;t sure what was wrong, but I knew I was having trouble breathing and couldn&#39;t swallow. I don&#39;t recall how long that symptom lasted but I don&#39;t think it was very long.</p><p></p><p>Fast forward to last week. On or about Wednesday the lump returned. I figured it would be as usual...go to bed, wake up, problem solved. But not this time. Here I am a week and a day later and the lump has not gone away.</p><p></p><p>I will shamefully admit that I am quite overweight. Obese, even. This is not news to me and I understand this will probably be the #1 cure to my problems. But I need something more immediate. A quicker fix that will allow for me to feel up to working out. A resolution for my &quot;lump&quot; so I feel capable of eating the right foods (as it is I haven&#39;t eaten anything in more than 24 hours because I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll feel like I&#39;m choking).</p><p></p><p>In addition to the lump in my throat I have been having the feeling of post-nasal drip. It came on at about the same time as the lump and I initially thought I was getting sick so I started taking Tussin. I haven&#39;t been taking that regularly though because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s my issue. I have been having dry throat on and off, but after some research I started chewing cinnamon flavored gum and that seems to help with the dryness. Lastly, I have been burping a lot more than normal and haven&#39;t drank anything other than water in over a week.</p><p></p><p>I&#39;ve tried multiple medicines over the last week. Of course Tums, but also Gaviscon extra strength, generic Mylanta, Ranitidine (generic Zantac) tablets, and Lansoprazole (generic Prevacid) 14-day course of treatment -- I&#39;m currently on day 7.</p><p></p><p>I spoke to a few people about my situation, one in particular who has experienced it before. In addition to acknowledging that I need to lose weight, the general consensus is that the sudden onset of severe symptoms may be stress-induced. In addition to having lost my job last month, I also suffered the loss of my cat who I had since I was 9 years old. She lived to be 18 and prior to her death she was very ill. She died on September 30.</p><p></p><p>One thing that is very strange is that my symptoms seems to subside when I&#39;m not actively thinking about them. For example, if I&#39;m engaged in conversation about something else I completely forget about the lump in my throat. For that reason, I wonder how much if it is psychological. I do tend to be obsessive when it comes to these types of things so I&#39;m sure my anxiety is not helping.</p><p></p><p>Please...any relief or advice you can provide. Please bear in my mind I&#39;m currently in between jobs therefore no insurance to see a doctor about this. Let me know your thoughts. Thanks in advance!</p>"

Throat feels so dry. I am going to give it a try. If I eat more fish do you think it would help.  Lots of good articles out there but here is just one of them that I like: [link removed] There is a chart with foods containing iodine and how much.

I have put a replacement link about iodine below from the BDA.[/b] https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/Iodine.pdf Thanks for sharing this Amy, I used to drink a lot of tea, that could have certainly contributed to my airway reflux. I have maybe one cup a day now and it is a lot better but not completely gone. Has anyone tried having an iodine supplement i.e.one drop a day in water, I figure that would be a good way of getting a regular dose? Also, does anyone know if you store iodine or is it something that you have to have on a regular basis? Thank you very much Amy. My wife is currently in hospital in excruciating pain every morning. At this point, and after a nissen fundiplication, 8 years of watching her suffer, over 50 trips to A and E, I'm willing to give anything a go. Brilliant post. Thank you Amy - well worth trying. I just wanted to give an update on how I'm doing since my original post. I appreciate seeing other people's follow up posts, so that you can tell if something really worked or not. Since stopping the tea, and avoiding fluoridated water, and taking a bunch of vitamins (not just iodine) to recover from all the malnutrition the tea caused me, I've been doing really amazingly well. I'm back to eating lots of chocolate and drinking carbonated (fluoride free) water now. I eat spicey food! I've even been able to go off all my allergy medication for the first time in over ten years. It's really pretty unbelievable. I don't think I'd believe my own post if I had lived through it myself. Has anyone else tried reducing fluoride exposure and increasing iodine, and has it helped?"

I'm going to cut right to the chase and tell you two things: don't drink tea! and also, make sure you are getting plenty of iodine in your diet! It turns out that in my case, my silent reflux was ultimately caused by the fluoride in tea combined with not enough iodine in my diet. The combination is very tricky to diagnose because they mask each other. So let me explain. Apparently, iodine is supremely important for every cell in the body. You need it for nearly every function in your body. An important one for LPR sufferers is the salivary gland. Not enough iodine means your salivary glands won't work very well. How does that affect or cause LPR? Well, part of the job of the salivary glands is to release bicarbonate into the saliva that you swallow all day, anytime that acid creeps up into the throat. It's an automatic response that normally helps protect the throat from acid. If you don't have enough iodine in your diet, then this isn't happening. You can tell if your salivary glands aren't working optimally by noticing how dry your mouth is in the morning. Feel the inside of your cheeks with your tongue. If your cheeks don't feel smooth, but instead feel bumpy, with raised areas from pressing on your teeth, you need more iodine. In my case, I assumed my dry mouth was caused by the zyrtec and singulair I take for my allergies. I was wrong. Most people know that you need iodine for your thyroid. The thyroid is so important that it's really too complicated for me to explain everything here. Trust me, it's really important and affects everything. It causes muscle weakness, among many other things. Think - diaphram - hiatal hernia! Also, a slightly swollen thyroid will give you that click when you swallow, like something is just in the way. So I know you're thinking, well i don't have iodine deficiency because I don't have a goiter, and my doctor did a thyroid blood test and my TSH was normal. I thought the same thing! It turns out, if you like to drink tea then you are getting a pretty large dosage of fluoride. Good for your teeth, right? Sure, but the bad news is fluoride affects the pituitary gland, telling it not to create thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH. Without TSH, your thyroid slows down, but your TSH blood test looks normal. There are lots of sources of fluoride and lots of websites talking about fluoride in the drinking water, but every where you look you read about how good green tea is for your health! When tea has much much more fluoride in it than municipal drinking water does. In fact, the tazo website touts it's tea for being a good source of fluoride - as if that's such a great thing! So maybe you don't drink any tea. That's good. And you use iodized salt. Okay, good. But, remember, the thyroid is so important that it gets first dibs on any iodine you do have in your diet, and in your body. The salivary glands, and the prostate and the ovaries, and the breasts and skin, and lots of other things in your body also need iodine. The RDA for iodine is currently only 150 mcg which is what an adult needs to keep the thyroid functioning and keep you from getting a goiter. But it's not enough for all the other parts of the body that need iodine to function. Iodine is naturally found in seafood, and seaweed (think sushi), and in plants and animals raised on land with iodine rich soil. Not every plot of land has much iodine, so iodine is added to salt in the US, but if you use fancy sea salt, or eat packaged food, or out at restaurants, you maybe not be getting iodine. Especially if you don't eat seafood. Iodine used to be added to bread in the US, but after 1980, most bakeries stopped doing that. Americans used to get about 600 mcg of iodine a day. Now they only get about 200mcg if they are lucky. Check your salt! But probably you'll have to do what I did and buy a supplement. I also now take a multi which has selenium, and important mineral to help you use iodine. I drank about one or two cups of tazo chai tea a day for the past three years. When I stopped drinking tea, initially all my symptoms got steadily worse. Without the fluoride, my thyroid was actually getting the TSH and it sucked up all the iodine I had everywhere else in my body. My mouth dried up and the throat mucus drip was ridiculous! My entire throat felt stiff and swollen. I lost my voice and had a weak voice for a long time. I did all of the recommended dietary changes for LPR. I stopped drinking carbonated water, and stopped eating chocolate, and acidic food. I slept nearly in a sitting position. I did everything suggested, except for acid reducing meds, and PPI's. I felt a little better, but just kept wondering why this was happening to me - I'd always been able to eat that stuff and I'd been fine. Then I read about iodine and fluoride and tea. I started just eating a lot of sushi and almost overnight felt like a new person. Of everything I've tried for LPR, the iodine supplementation is what has helped the most. My mouth is no longer dry, I don't have to sip water constantly all day. I don't have a weird glob in my throat. When I eat, food doesn't feel like it's taking forever to go down, or getting stuck in my esophagus. There are probably a lot of people who don't have any problem with iodine, or their thyroid, or fluoride causing their LPR symptoms, but it's worth taking a look. Regardless, don't drink tea! If you switched from coffee to tea becaose of reflux, stop! Tea should have a warning on it about the fluoride. PS, I'm not the type of person to write stuff like this, but it's made such an impact on my health, and I never want someone to struggle if they don't have to. Hope this helps someone. Amy"

          " Hi Abby I was new on this site a few weeks ago as I suffer from Osteoarthritis but am under a rheumatologist for unexplained raised inflamatory markers. He has also given me a diagnosis of CFS/ME and Fibromyalgia but this has been based on my symptoms that I have had for the past 3 years now and have been signed off work for 3 months. I can't even find the strength to get dresses or have a bath most days - I'm not only exhausted but have so many other symptoms you can read on my other entries. Mine has a possible onset which was around the time I had campylobacter infection and then caught colostrium difficle in hospital (hospital bug). Have you had any illnesses that you think may have been a trigger point? I am thinking you are probably suffering with stress and stress related illness can leave you feeling totally drained and give you many of the symptoms you describe. You need to see if you gp feels you should be signed off for a while so you can rest and give your body some time to recover. It is a horrible vicious circle but you must be positive - I really do hope it is not CFS. Take care and let me know how your appt goes.  Hey Abby, My current diagnosis is post viral fatigue. Having been a high level amateur endurance athlete for about 6 years all of a sudden in Nov2013 starting feeling off, I remember around about Christmas time haw utterly awful I felt. Well I can associate with lots that you say, especially struggling to get words out. I told my dad and others I sometimes get really afraid because it's as if I am going to lose the ability to speak. Well anyway things that have helped me, and I have improved in the 5 months. The only thing that bothers me is I have an uneasy feeling in my chest, like my heart is being suffocated, I don't feel ill in others ways. It's only because of this I cannot run, swim etc It's like there is a blockage on my heart utilising it's full power. I pray and hope this goes away, because I am no enjoying life like I used to, I cannot feel the same way etc So things that helped me, high dose vitamin C, 20g/day spread throughout the day in 4 5g doses. You might want to experiement with that for a week or 2. And medicinal mushrooms. Mushroom Science immune builder formula. It is quite expensive but I feel it relaxes me in some way and has helped me sleep much better. I'm naturopathically trained so have many years experience with supplements etc I say all we can do is eat well, rest well and pray. This is what I am doing to free me from this horrible condition. I used to exercise 5 times week plus work, I've since cancelled my gym memebership because the will to go has been taken from me, it's not that I don't want to go, it's like this mechanism inside my body just shuts me down. Having trained my body for years I know it quite well. I think definitely talk to your employer. I've been off work since I was ill and financially it's not been easy. Thanks for your responses guys :) Gizmo1963; I did originally think it could be stress but when I think about when I first started experiencing these symptoms (a good few years ago) I hadn't started this job. I was working for myself and remember even then I was constantly tired with brain fog and really struggling to motivate myself on a daily basis and I was only working part-time hours from home. I have no doubts that working the hours I currently do aren't helping in any way, so I will have to do something about it. I had an infected abscess removed from my lower back around 10 years ago and it took a long, long time to heal because the wound kept getting infected. Ever since then I have seemed to catch any bug going so that could be a possible trigger. Again, waking up this morning from an 8 hour sleep I do not feel refreshed in the slightest. I physically couldn't sleep for any longer, yet I feel so fatigued. David; I cannot imagine how you feel going from being so active to not being able to run at all. I too used to exercise quite a lot, I loved to go out for long walks and dabbled in running. Now it is near impossible for me to walk up two flights of stairs when leaving work without feeling worn out. I hate it. I'm concerned that my GP will put this down to stress as that seems like the obvious link, but I genuinely think it's not the case. Obviously I'm prepared to go through whatever's necessary to find the underlying cause but at the same time I'm worried that they won't truly understand just how terrible I feel. Hi abbey, cfs as 3 classifications of severity mild, moderate , and severe it's possible when you experienced the symptoms previously they were mild and subsided. Research shows that people developing cfs/me and fibromyalgia are usually high achievers and from your post it looks like you have a stressful job. Many number Of Things can trigger cfs one of these is your physical and mental health under prolonged stress. In order for you to be diagnosed with cfs you need to have the symptoms for at least 6months or more and all other conditions with similar symptoms need to be ruled out by blood tests. If you are adamant that stress is not causing Your symptoms you need to make a list of all the symptoms you have book a double appt with your gp if your practice allows and if stress is mentioned you need to be very proactive in informing them that you are almost sure it's not stress but that you feel that you fit the criteria for cfs. Although it's very difficult early diagnosis is essential to help you manage this very debilitating array of symptoms.  Hi Abby. Your symtoms sound a lot like CFS and you are correct to suspect that stress alone does not explain brain fog, lethargy and pains. I and my family members have self-diagnosed me on three separate occasions with three severe conditions, and I only got the doctor's confirmation afterwards. Like Susie says, it is also typical for this condition to affect people who have previously been very active. That's because with problems in blood circulation etc., people with CFS unconsciously feel the need to activate their sympathetic nervous system, and it also happens that they enjoy excercise. Eventually you'll need to talk to your employer, and it may be helpful to do it sooner than later. I could not have continued working withouth explaining what's wrong with me.  Hay there from down under ..Australia.. While u are in the process of diagnosis ... Have you been tested for SLE LUPUS? I have had lupus for 7 years now.. Iam sunlight sensitive , joint and muscle pain.. Several fatigue. I have trouble with memory and with my letters. I make a lot of spelling mistakes and don't realise it...I have problems concentrating.. Everything u have said ,,, sound like lupus to me... Please consider it... I saw my doctor this afternoon and she suspects I have Fibromyalgia which I guess isn't too dissimilar of CFS. I'm having routine blood tests to rule out the usual suspects and if it is what she suspects she said she wants to trial a course of anti-depressants to see if that helps with the brain fog. I've been advised to cut my hours down at work, not to over do things and listen to what my body is telling me. I'm so glad that she didn't instantly jump to stress and actually listened to me. Getting my bloods done tomorrow so I shall keep you all posted! Hi Abby So pleased to hear your doctor has listened to you and is starting to help you. Cutting down your hours will hopefully help you but your work manager must also understand not to place any extra pressure on you. Sorry but I want to say so much more but I'm rather brain dead tonight. You take care and will catch up with you after my rest - if I'm able to sleep. Take care xx Hi Tracey I was reviewing lupus site today as I've been very sensitive to sunlight and have noticed I have redness across my nose and cheeks and also been getting scabs in my scalp so my rheumy has asked me to see a dermatologist. Just waiting for an appt x Glad to hear from you.. The waiting for test results aren't easy. Glad to see that you are taking everything into consideration. They may do a small biopsy on the rash. Depending in how bad the rash is.. I have had that many types of tests at the beginning of lupus and diagnosis does take a long time. Keep us posted.. Best of kick. I had my blood tests yesterday morning and luckily for me my mum is a phlebotomist so she did it for. She's ever so gentle and it didn't hurt at all, although I did get a sensation where I could feel the blood being drawn out which I have never experienced before. Afterwards my arm ached SO badly, much more than normal. It was like I couldn't grip things properly and my hand was extremely cold for a good 6 hours afterwards. There is slight bruising around where the needle was inserted but nothing severe. Have any of you found that the side effect of blood tests have gotten worse with the condition?  Well darlin with lupus , everything is over sensitive...did the blood tests include lupus? Let me know how u went. Luv Tracey. Hi. My son had bad fatigue and headache for around 5 months 18 months ago. He had blood tests and nothing showed up. Then he seemed to get better and back to normal. About a month ago the fatigue came back and he is once again wiped out but managing to work but no social life at all. He is 30. He doesn\u2019t have the joint pains which I read about. Could this be Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. He was abroad for 5 months before it started 18 months ago and wonder if he could\u2019ve picked something up. Thanks for any insight into this.  Update! My mum works at my doctor surgery so was able to call her friend at work to check if my blood results had come back. They had and after getting a doctor to check them they have come back...NORMAL. I knew they would. I guess this is a good thing as it means I'm one step closer to a diagnosis, but part of me wanted it to be an underactive thyroid or something that was more easily treatable. I am feeling terrible today. I had to work a full 8 hour day on Saturday (although I spent most of the day in the staff room just delegating tasks to the girls) and it seems to have wiped me out entirely. I am so exhausted and achy and the brain fog is horrendous. I have also noticed, since last Wednesday/Thursday a return of my hyperhidrosis. I was first diagnosed with this around 4 years ago and get it in my palms and soles of my feet. I hadn't had it for a good year before now (I received Iontophoresis treatment when first diagnosed) so I was just wondering if any other CFS sufferers also have this? Am seeing my doctor tomorrow so will post another update then! Hi Abby have you had your blood test results back yet and did anything show up? I've been suffererring with some very severe migraines with pain through my sinuses, tooth and ears. Always right sided and had this for many years. Also bad tinitus. My tiredness is made even worse by this and it takes so much effort to just even climb out of bed. Feeling down - just want my life back. "

          "Hi all, another newbie here! For the last couple of month's I have been feeling physically exhausted and always tired with extreme brain fog. I did what most of us do and put it down to working too much. I am 28 years old, work 38+ hours a week as a retail manager for a very demanding independent company and I never get 2 days off in a row so rarely get a chance for a proper rest. I have been off work for the past 3 days as it has all got too much for me to handle. I am physically struggling to get out of bed because my body aches, constantly have the feeling of lethargy, my head never feels clear, concentrating and motivation is near impossible, I struggle getting my words out sometimes and the one that gets me is that even upon waking up it feels like I haven't slept at all. On top of that I constantly have a sore and dry throat (which I originally thought was down to the air conditioning at work) and I have also noticed an increased sensitivity to bright lights, including the sun! I had similar symptoms a few years ago, but not this severe and I was tested for anaemia and also hypothyroidism which came back normal, so I just went away and did the whole healthy lifestyle/exercise thing. Exercise is now near impossible, either because I'm too tired to even start or because when I do the after effects make me feel worse. I am going to the doctors again tomorrow and from reading other posts in this forum I understand it takes a long time to be diagnosed with CFS. Has anyone here self diagnosed themselves beforehand and then later had it confirmed by their GP? I've been researching this condition a lot today and everything I read describes exactly how I feel. Would it be a good idea for me to talk to my employer and express how much I am struggling? I don't think I can physically continue to work the hours that I currently am, but I can't afford to not work. What would you suggest? Thanks in advance :)"

Worse ones are swollen turbinates in my nose, very hard of breath which I&#39;m suspecting is lung inflammation not asthma, hair loss with an itchy burning scalp, significant weight loss even when I&#39;ve been over on calories, the flu 3 times, coldsore/ulcers 4 times (mainly in my nose), blocked ears, sore neck, migraines, anxiety, it goes on. I only get temporary times were I feel more normal-ish and then it comes back worse. I&#39;ve presented to the doctor numerous times, mainly about my breathing and they shrug me off saying it&#39;s allergies and asthma or make me out to be a hypochondriac. I&#39;m on my third doctor now. Bloods came back positive for ANA and Rheumatoid factor but not dsDNA or ELA, so last time I went he said &quot;it&#39;s not an autoimmune disease&quot; to which I was a bit taken aback and replied &quot;I still have my suspicions&quot;. I&#39;m going back again on Monday and insisting on a referral to a Rheumatologist as I suspect Lupus and this obviously goes above just allergies. Sounds like you may be in a similar boat. I&#39;ve been talking to people here and they say it&#39;s very hard to get doctors to diagnose so we have to be persistent... Has you doctor been supportive? How long have you been having your symptoms?</p> Tammy my heart goes out to you. I have looked up your test result on the internet. You don\u2019t say what your diagnosis is but, according to the test result it is probably Scleroderma. I have just recently had a diagnosis of Lupus or Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), another autoimmune disease closely related to Scleroderma. Both have the \u201cCREST\u201d symptoms \u2013 C Calcium deposits which cause thickening of the skin in nodules (like my right palm which has pulled my 3rd finger down). R Reynaud\u2019s Disease or white finger due to cold and damaged blood vessels (arterioles) bringing insufficient blood in suddenly cold conditions \u2013 I have this too, only discovered the name recently. E Heartburn which can be quite severe with difficulty swallowing and acid reflux. Yep gottit! S Sclerodactyly \u2013 I had to look this one up. It\u2019s shortness of breath usually accompanied with dizziness, chest pain, fainting, chronic fatigue, and dry cough usually associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension \u2013 I think that\u2019s another way of saying difficulty in breathing. Oh how I wish these guys would use plain English! I just have the dry cough and throat as in Sjogrens Syndrome. T Telangiectasias \u2013 looked this one up too. Small dilated blood vessels near the surface known as spider veins. Still means nothing to me. Possibly related to Reynaud\u2019s or rosacea. It\u2019s a strong undeniable result and, the sources say, no change in lifestyle eg diet will help. NHS UK says (I\u2019m a Brit \u2013 not sure what this website covers as I\u2019m a newbie) is a rare condition with hardened areas of skin and sometimes problems with internal organs and blood vessels. And its chronic ie incurable. Like Lupus \u2013 lupus has lung implications too but I\u2019m not there yet!. I have chronic dandruff, blepharitis, dry eye, dry throat, mouth and lips, acid refux/heartburn, arthritis, constipation, fatigue and depression. In a breakthrough last June I found a link to the first of those five in an internet search \u2013 demodex mites. It\u2019s our most common human ectoparasite ie skin parasite, thought not to be a problem. But if you use google scholar and search \u201ccondition + demodex\u201d (or demodicosis the worldwide recognition of the disease) you get some results. i) It\u2019s not a problem unless you have a permanent weakness in your immune system or a temporary weakness due to stress, ageing or medication \u2013 in which case you may have an infestation which leads to symptoms such as my six above. We all have some from your mum at birth, it\u2019s the density that counts. ii) It\u2019s controversial \u2013 UK medical specialists eg Rheumatologists, Opthalmologists know about it but don\u2019t formally recognise it yet \u2013 they need prodding! iii) There is strong, but so far only circumstantial evidence, that they may be the cause of various forms of inflammatory auto-immune disease of the connective tissues \u2013 that includes scleroderma, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. They are known to be a vector for bacteria and fungal infections and they have been linked with vascular and arteriole damage conditions in eg Reynauds. iv) Numerous research studies show that conditions like Blepharitis or Rosacea disappear when treated with a miticide eg ivermectin taken either orally or topically as a cream. v) What triggered my search last June was a painful bite inside my eyelid. Ten years ago I felt a similar bite inside the top joint of my small finger on my right hand already infected with arthritis in the first two fingers. The pain was brief but my husband and I watched as a thin red line circumnavigated that joint over the space of a week. Anecdotal evidence, but it does point a finger. vi) We hear constantly about bacteria and viruses but less about fungal infections (eg candida) and even less about parasites. Why? It was suggested to me recently that the human body does not attack itself. But a successful parasite might deceive the immune system by clothing itself in the body\u2019s own fluids eg lipids. Antibodies to these lipids have been found in some of the auto-immune diseases suggesting this might be the case. Ask about your antibody test. Its just a theory. But what have you got to lose? You\u2019re right to be scared and brave to SHOUT for help as you have done. Scream, cry, rant to let it all out. Then calm down as you are the one to save yourself, no-one else. Think about these ideas, research them for yourself, prepare to stand up to your Rheumatologist, who may not want your views \u2013 but you have a right to a second opinion and a right to request that you be given a chance to try out ivermectin, taken daily, orally for at least 4 weeks I suggest. If there is no improvement you may have to back down \u2013 they are the experts. Corticosteroids weaken the immune system and should be avoided. Coconut oil in solid cold pressed virgin form half a tablespoon twice a day in yoghurt or tea is an immune system booster but there are other natural boosters if you search. My prayers are with you. If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them or send you some of my research \u2013 but it seems this Forum is somewhat limited in this regard.  <p>My friend has a syndrom CREST, which sounds rather like what you are suffering.&#160; Not entirely, but in some respects.&#160; You could check out her blog &#39;[b]beyondthebellyache.[b]wordpress[/b].com[/b]&#39; I think she has quite a lot of help with her symptoms</p><p>Good luck</p>"

          " Hi Gale!as you know I am in the same boat! i\u2019ve had it for about the same length of time as you. I would rather have another condition that was more manageable than to ever have this! not enough is known about it and I think that\u2019s why there\u2019s so many frustrated miserable people with anxiety and panic., Along with all the symptoms.are you still getting symptoms all day long? I always have at least one going on, then they switch. So frustrating! I don\u2019t know what happened to my messages because I don\u2019t see the word Messages on the top right corner. All I see is notifications. \u2764 Hi. yes it can be very frustrating and I\u2019m sorry you are going through this. I can\u2019t believe how long both of us have had this!! when is the last time you have had any kind of a test? Also have you seen specialists recently like a neurologist or any other doctor? i\u2019m just trying to take it one day at a time. Im trying to figure out how to get my messages back. It\u2019s weird.  i know that anxiety can be a chronic condition just like diabetes or heart disease. for some people it\u2019s not as bad as others . but like myself, I\u2019ve had it since I was a child and then it took different forms. Back then I was just anxious but I didn\u2019t have the weird symptoms. In my late 20s is when I started getting the symptoms and from then on it was a roller coaster . It\u2019s never truly gone away completely. I doubt it ever will. but I hope that you can get some relief from the symptoms also. I guess they took away private messaging.  Hello I am 24 yr old female, I dnt drink or smoke. Im 5'5 145lbs. Almost 2 months ago, I had a pain occur where the best I can describe it as if someone took a balloon and slowly squeezed all the air out. It happened again 10 days later. Both while sitting and both sudden and gone withing a fewseconds. Since that incident, i have had persistent discomforts and pain in the chest since this. Seemingly amplified at night. The pains and discomforts are now accompanied sometimes by headaches and/or pain and/or burning sensation in my limbs. Last night when trying to sleep the sensations were heart palpitations, light headed, and feeling weak in the chest, tightness in left arm, and sometimes a pinching pain in chest. I also have a dry cough from a tickling sensation in throat all day everyday now. My EKG, blood work, and chest xray were all normal but yet everyday and almostALL day no matter what I'm doing i am constantly having shortness of breath that feels like my heart is just about to shut down. Yeah, I'm also constantly fearing that I have some serious neurological disease. I got really strong anxiety yesterday again and my symptoms seem to have gotten worse because of it. I have so many physical symptoms that I find it difficult to accept that it could just be anxiety (you can see all my symptoms in my recent post). What symptoms have you been experiencing? In my case, I'm finding the brain fog, dizziness, and overall body aches/weakness to be the worst of them all."

When will i feel normal again!!! Anyone here having this problem."
