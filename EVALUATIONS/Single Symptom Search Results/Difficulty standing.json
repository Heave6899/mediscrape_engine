          " It is good to hear a positive side to knee replacement. I have had both my knees replaced - the first one took place in November 2014 and the second in November 2016. I am always still so surprised that I am able to walk normally again - it is lovely - and something that we do not value until we are hit with the pain of arthritis! I am so glad that I live in an age where medical technology has advanced to the stage where they are able to do these operations. I can remember my grandmother having to live downstairs. She would walk about the house with the aid of a walking stick and did not venture further than the front door. No knee replacement operations available in those days. I know that the first few months are an ordeal to get through but so worth it in the end. Hope you continue with your good health Ranger Jack. Take care of yourself and thank you for the blessing.  <p>Good for you!!! I&#39;m at 8 1/2mths. And pretty much everything you describe. I do have a nagging (but not all of the time) pain on the inner part of my knee. Massaging with cold pain relief gel and icing helps. My exercises at the gym are going well. I am increasing&#160;the length of time on the machines (treadmill, elliptical, bike &amp; leg press) as my muscles get stronger. &#160;And I can dance again!! &#128513; I have no regrets about the surgery either!! I am doing far more than I was able to this time last year!! I wish you continued success with your recovery!! Oh!! That popping/clicking sound....my surgeon says it&#39;s the plastic part rubbing on the metal part of the replacement part, and it&#39;s normal.&#160;</p> Thank you so much for sharing! I am five months post op...life has never been better. Lots of the minor issues you mention I find also...But sooooooo great to have a knee I can rely on!  <p>So nice to &#160;hear some positive reports about TKR. &#160;I am now 9 weeks out from my surgery and still going to therapy 3x a week. I am doing well with minimal pain. &#160;I still cannot sit for very long with the knee bent. &#160;I find I need to keep it elevated a good part of the day and I cannot walk very far yet. &#160;I am no longer relying on a cane. &#160;I can go up the stairs &quot;normally&quot; but must go down one step at a time leading with the operative leg. I am sleeping better. &#160;I can drive, but drove for an hour + last weekend and my leg was swollen afterward.&#160;It has been hard work in therapy and keeping a positive attitude at times. &#160;I am looking forward to dancing again! &#160;Thanks for the encouraging reports.</p> <p>Hi Ranger jack</p><p>Great to hear that you are doing well and being so very positive I&#39;m coming up to 12 months post TKR and also the stairs up and down still a little painful but im getting around the golf course like a good un and the great thing about it is theres no pain or swelling i wish you all the good luck in the world take care.</p> Congratulations! You have accomplished a large part of the healing process and you are not having any pain. The stairs will come soon. Continue to go up and down, but please hold on to the railings. One day will be the norm. I am post 10 months TKR and still cannot bend my knee to 120, but could go up and down the stairs with no problem. Everyone heals differently.

          " hello gillian, This happened to me as well. when i accept some symptom as my anxiety trigger then that symptom goes and some other comes.. i have been experienced more than 100 physical symptoms from 4 years.. i am on medication so getting better now and just ignoring whatever symptom i have every day.. so just ignore whatever happens to you. symptoms will go once your mind forgets about them. hope this helps.. Thanks, Umar Khan. this happens to me too its draining its horriffic i freak out when the glands in my neck feel swollen some days i cant breath some days i can but i feel sick ive forgotten what normal feels like the only thing that helps me is if i tire myself out walking the dogs so that i sleep on a night i feel hopeless in the day at home but better when my boyfriend gets home  Hi Gillian, I am suffering from exactly same thing. I suffer from muscle pain , numbness, and other anxiety symptoms which make me freak out it is fibromyalgia every 2 days. I sail in the same boat.  Hi. **Please read this. You're not alone. You're getting there ! Hang tight! ** **This was me 2 months ago** I have this for almost 3 years now. Constant! 24/7. Multiple tests In order to clarify all the confusion that engulfs everyone who is currently suffering from GAD or health anxiety I can safely validate this that as I'm in the process of documenting this post I am experiencing a slight panic attack and breathing difficulty and some sort of discomfort. I'm 29 years old. Living in Athens, Greece and 2 years ago I had everything on the tip of my finger. I am working for a multinational advertising agency, had pretty much everything I needed in life although I was stressful since birth. A life full of joy, fun and adventure. Friends, lots of women ( please don't mock me there's a reason I'm writing all of this itty bitty info. [cheesygrin] [wink] 2 years ago I bumped my head in a cabinet, had something of a soft concussion. Nothing extraordinary. 3 days later I woke up with severe clutter headache. A sense of pressure, weight in my forehead, eyes, nose even mouth some days. Mind you this was 24/7. No breaks, no early check-outs. 24/7 all day, everyday. For 2 and a half gruesome years. Still standing. Mind you again that Greece has highly qualified doctors and medical facilities ranking them amongst the greatest and most efficient in the world. My complete medical exams as of now, 2 years and 3 days after, are a mixture of: a CT 3 days after, MRI 15 days after. Both clean. Had a second MRI about two months ago. None. 4 Blood tests, 2 urine tests, 2 triplex heart tests, 1 lungs CT (obvious reason) 2 exams of gastroscopy, 1 neck x ray, 1 testicles x ray, 4 visits/tests in 3 different neurologists and ONLY 1 VISIT TO A PSYCHOLOGIST/THERAPIST (SHAME SHAME SHAME) Along with the feeling of having something terminal (tumor, cancer, plague, divers' disease) I had other symptoms as well. Joint pains, muscle tensions & pain, blurred vision, eye pain, short breath, spastic movement, fear, fatigue, more fear, inability to think, focus, foggy mind, insomnia, derealisation, tremor, armpits pain when touched, numerous digestive issues. And along with all those beautiful feelings I also had oulitis, or inflammation of the gum, common you may think. On the contrary I had been spiting blood and a series of liquids close to the orange color. These were mainly from the digestion problems I was experiencing. A process called Palindromisis. However I was convinced that I was spitting blood because I had terminal cancer along with the brain tumor related to my cluster/tension headaches. A poor diagnosis in my gum related problem led me to believe that. Just 1 week ago it was confirmed that it was oulitis. Thanks a bunch for the first failed test on me doc. Nowadays and 2 years after all this rather uncomfortable situation I had overcome most of my issues and psychosomatic tribulations but a new challenger arrived to claim this poor soul. Heart palpitations. I always had them. Big deal I thought. But no. This time of year this was not the case. I had experienced a new form of heart palpitations. A more mature one. A newly developed. I thought my heart was dying, shutting down as I was feeling a burning sensation in the left part of my chest and neck. Imbalance, fear, this is how it ends right? Skipping beats, slow beats, fast paced beats. All this in a crazy run. BY GOD JIM I had the fear of God in me. I'm feeling uneasy and I'm currently experiencing palpitations as I write this. I begin this as a sort of self-cleansing but I also though it could help a poor-struggling soul. YOU HAVE NOTHING WRONG. YOUR WORST FEARS ARE MANIFESTING INSIDE YOU. FOOLING YOUR BODY. FOOLING YOU. YOU 'RE NOT DYING. YOUR SANITY IS. KEEP CALM. AVOID TOXIC PEOPLE. AVOID TOXIC LIFE. BREATHE IN. BREATHE OUT. EMBRACE YOURSELF. LET PEOPLE KNOW. MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND. IF NOT, F**K THEM. DITCH THEM OUT. KEEP CALM. TAKE A BIG BREATH IN. LET IT ALL OUT. DO YOU SEE THE END OF THE TUNNEL? NO! IT'S NOT YOUR TIME YET. LIVE LIFE.  * I say this ALL the time haha. As soon as I get used to one symptom it goes away and a new one comes up - ready to frighten me all over again. It's sooo frustrating. I try to see the humor in it and say \"well eventually my body is going to run out of symptoms to produce right?\" haha but then who knows. * I've had tension headaches, cluster headaches, numb/tingling arms & legs, chest pains/tightness in chest, lump in throat, tension in my head/neck/face, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pains, blurry vision & seeing \"spots\", and more lol. * At the moment I've been dealing with chronic itch, it comes and goes and is anywhere on my body, but mostly my neck and hands. I'm assuming it must be anxiety related bc on the weekend, when I'm out with friends and distracted, I rarely feel itchy. * I haven't really learned to cope with new symptoms, I've only learned to cope with symptoms I've already had. Like if I get chest pains now it doesn't make me that nervous bc I've had them before and I know it's just my anxiety. But when new symptoms show up I always get nervous at first. Thank you for all your replies. At least it's nice to know you're not alone. It seems to simple to someone who has never suffered when they tell you it's not real, it's in your head. It all feels so real. The last few days I have managed to fine some peace at times and get a bit of a rest which helps massively. I have been taking my anti depressant, zoloft ( or sertraline), again. This does help me a lot with my anxiety, it's only been about two weeks since I re started and it can take a while to kick in but it has taken the edge off a bit and is stopping me from escalating to full blown panic so I have been able to cut down on the beta blockers a bit over the last few days to maybe one or two a day. I have run out of my two week valium prescription which was to help me try and get back into a good sleep pattern. I have tried to take a hot shower before bed with some lavender oil and have found a tea from the health food store that is meant to help with a good nights sleep. I have also found taking a couple of Kalms tablets can help keep me asleep for longer so I am managing ok off the valium at the moment, although I never feel like I am fully asleep I'm always aware of noises and sounds round about me. I'm hoping once the anti depressant starts working properly then my sleep will get back to normal. Thank you for all your support and if I can offer any in return I am happy to. Im going through the samething right now stomach issues i just feel so numb all over my neck and back feels so heavy like the mucles pulling me down .i been having stomach is issue i had sigmoidoscopy done yesterday and its was all clear . i just dont feel normal im just fustrated im not being normal i was fine 2 months ago until i fell i hit my chin and head then i started to worry about my head and i dont know if that cause my anxiety which i never had problems with my health .its making me feel like im going to die .im so confused if its actually a health issue or stress.does medication help im scared of the side affects? hi, i get this! my anxiety manifested itself in stomach issues whereas now i have: fatigue....awful fatigue. I ask myself if its a sinister illness... and i panic about it. even though i know that fatigue is related to anxiety/ depression, i just can't accept it. i spoke to another Doctor today who recommended that i don't repeat blood tests i did 6 months ago because nothing has changed... i hate being like this  You sound just like me, annual blood test set me off waiting for results. then seems I have low potassium levels and a other blood test. I just go to pieces with worry, thinking all sorts, off my food, driving my partner insane. Suppose we are glass half empty people. so your not alone. Hi- Please know that you are not alone in how you're feeling. I have battled GAD all my life (I'm 46). It wasn't until I was in my early thirties that I even realized I had it. I just figured everyone felt the way I did. After I had my second daughter I became hyper-aware of what was going on in my body. I would have all these physical symptoms and fixate on them. During that time I was at the doctor a lot. I never thought it could be anxiety because I was physically feeling all of these symptoms that I didn't know could come from anxiety. I went to the doctor for stomach problems and back issues. I developed migraines with auras. Eventually I was tested for MS and lupus because I developed tremors and tingling feet/hands. Heart monitor for flip flopping heart. Every time the tests came back negative. Thank God :) It was after all that that I started to research anxiety physical symptoms. Sure enough, the minute I would get the all clear from the doctor the symptoms would go away and something else would pop up. It's so frustrating because you are physically feeling what you're feeling. Just know you're not alone. One thing I find helpful is to journal. Also to write down the physical symptom I'm concerned with. I have a list on my phone and when I see all the symptoms I've been worried about and how all over the board they are it helps.I also will tell myself that I am not equipped to make a medical diagnosis. I will give myself x amount of days with the symptom and if it doesn't go away I'll go to my doctor (whom I trust very much). Finally, I take a product called Calm at night, which is a magnesium supplement. It and a warm epsom salt bath is super relaxing before bed. Anyway, hope this helps. Hang in there. Anxiety sucks but the fact that you recognize that what it is is half the battle. You've got this :)  I have been experiencing a new symptom that is very bothersome. My jaws feels restless all the time and never feels relaxed. This keeps causing annoying dull pain in lower jaws and headaches sometimes. Another feeling I have been having in my head, usually in the morning to mid-day, is this rushed/tense/buzzed feeling going down both sides of my head. It is very hard to explain the sensation is gives me, but it is very annoying and almost feels like I could go into a seizure or stroke....even though I have no idea what either feel like because I have never had one. I wish there was a vitamin or supplement that could cure this, but I am worried it is just anxiety. Does anyone else know the feeling I am describing? It not really a tension headache, but more of a state of feeling rushed and panic?"

          "Hey there I'm just looking for some support and to see if others notice a similar pattern in their anxiety battles. I suppose my anxiety is mainly centred around health, although other things in my life can set me off which in turn results in the physical symptoms that turn into health anxiety. I find that as soon as I have come to terms with one symptoms and almost accepted it as anxiety, and not life threatening, that another, unrelated one pops up from no where just to continue the process. It's as if my anxiety can disguise itself as so many different things and it makes it even harder to over come. I am getting there, slowly. I'm back on my anti depressants and just trying to push through but it seems I'll have a good day or two and then it just hits me again. Usually during the night, I always find the night time hardest to deal with. Less distractions I suppose. Do any of you feel the same about your anxiety, how do you cope with the changing physical symptoms and do you have any useful tips for when it strikes, especially during the night. Thanks for the support."

I think It is so easy for people to get anxious, but forget to trust their own body knows how to heal. I guess in the end, as with all Things we negotiate a way through. Fear does create the tendency to over do things, yet complacency probably results In not getting a steady rate of progress. I think the reasons why people take the approaches they do are very interesting!  <p>Great post Ozziegee makes good reading. I am only day 10 post op left TKR. My experience would seem to be different to the &quot;norm&quot; I&#39;ve had minimal pain was up from day one managing in shower etc. Went home day 3 and have gone from strength to strength. Minimal pain and now walking with 1 stick. Not been outside yet though other than. To be taken for appointment. Am doing my physio exercises and pushing hard as my physio pushes me but not too hard. Am finding I have that tight band feeling and my thigh is twinging now which I feel maybe because my gait has altered. I have been massaging my thigh with a sports roller to try and help. Am struggling to straighten my leg but do appreciate it&#39;s very early days.</p><p>Was good to hear how your doing and good to read your post</p> <p>Firstly - &#39;quick, successful rehab&#39; - dont think there is such a thing as truly &#39;quick&#39;.&#160; My op was 1st March and while I FEEL normal now, I&#39;m sure there is still a lot of healing going on!</p><p></p><p>We&#39;ve seen from this group that physios vary HUGELY.&#160; They seem to be two extremes - bully the patient until they&#39;re in tears, or go about it gently!&#160; Not sure if the tears are necessary with some - don&#39;t know the answer to that one, but can only say for me, not even having any physio other than the day I was in hospital, and a leaflet, was the best outcome.&#160; I made fast progress and have been utterly happy with it.&#160; Certainly googling does leave you with questions so you need to be careful where you get info from.&#160; Anyone can say anything on the internet, but studies done are often the most reliable information.&#160; Or NHS sites etc.&#160; Or stuff published in medical journals.</p><p></p><p>Interesting about the &#39;natural herb&#39; that helped your pain.&#160; What was it?&#160; Even though it&#39;s a natural herb, I&#39;d still suggest looking up side effects etc. and checking it out, but it sounds interesting!</p><p></p><p>As far as ice and elevation go, in the first few weeks I was icing virtually all day (stop it before doing bending exercises) and elevating virtually all day too.&#160; It worked well for me!&#160; I started the bike at just before three weeks and gradually got more active at that point.&#160; But people are all different.&#160; By about five weeks I&#39;d stopped icing completely - it wasn&#39;t making any difference then, but STILL elevate when I sit down at home.&#160; I should clarify though - I used the ice cuff which meant moving the ice from one side down to underneath the knee and then to the other side (I never iced over the scar because I reckoned that needed the blood flow for healing faster) so it was rotating all the time.&#160; So it probably was 20 minutes out of the hour as it went round to the three positions.&#160; I&#39;ve not rushed to walk any particular distance.&#160; Partly because the other knee is so bad, but I reckon initial period is about flexibility and healing rather than strength.&#160; Having said that, I am doing the bike for 7 or 8 minutes a day and a treadmill for the same period.&#160; I&#39;m using the bike at level 7 or 8 now, whereas before the op I only did level 1!&#160; But I think it all comes down to what suits the individual best!&#160; And physios don&#39;t seem to really keep that in mind - they seem to have a &#39;one size fits all&#39; approach and not be that flexible to each person!&#160; So in the end we&#39;re left with finding what works best for us all personally.&#160; Those of us who have had babies will tell you its just the same then - each midwife has their own ideas and you get conflicting information.&#160; It&#39;s human nature LOL!&#160; But good luck to you!:-))))&#160; I wish you a good recovery:-))))</p>"

          "<p>Today, Thursday May 18, 2017 marks the 13th week after my Knee Replacement surgery. I have to admit I was a bit naive as to what to expect with my recovery. I&#39;d previously had a hip replaced and mistakenly figured recovery would be similar. Not so.</p><p></p><p>One of my surprises was the disagreements as to how to best proceed post op to achieve a quick, successful rehab. Doctors, Nurses, Physical Therapists, fellow patients, friends...seem to contradict each other, all very confident their way is the correct way.</p><p></p><p>I&#39;ll speak of my experience and confusion. I came to the decision I needed to stop &quot;googling&quot; for answers because the answers, opinions, etc., always left me with more questions.</p><p></p><p>I was shocked by the amount of pain from this surgery and the efforts to control it. For pain meds I was initially given Percocet, that seemed to work ok but my blood pressure kept dropping and I became dizzy when standing. Eventually after trying something else I can&#39;t remember, I was prescribed 50 mg of Tramadol. That stopped the dizziness but did little to curb the pain. Even after leaving the Hospital I had difficulty controlling the pain, that was until I accidentally (from reading someone&#39;s story) came across a controversial, natural herb that did the trick.</p><p></p><p>The biggest confusion has been with the right way to handle Physical Therapy and rehab exercises. Even the Therapists disagree on this. Some believe the aggressive, no pain no gain approach is the best, others feel that does more harm than good and could actually impede recovery. I had four different Therapist working with me, two were &quot;aggressive&quot;, two were &quot;gentle&quot;. Across the Internet from what I can see, opinions are split on this. I&#39;ve had lots of advice but at the time I&#39;m writing this I&#39;m still unsure of the best approach. One Doctor or Therapist will list the best exercises to do at home and the next will say half of them are dangerous. I&#39;ve read where walking is good for you but I&#39;ve also read where walking increases swelling and should be avoided during early recovery.</p><p></p><p>Then there&#39;s the icing and elevation. Sounds simple but for how long, how often? Yesterday someone who should know said I need to ice for at least an hour and repeat 4-5 times a day. I&#39;d never heard that before, most professionals say 15-20 minutes.</p><p></p><p>For me I&#39;m doing the gentle stretches with the occasional &quot;nudge&quot;, I ice, elevate for about 20 minutes 4-5 times and walk about a mile every day but who knows? Only time will tell. I think most of us reach our destination in the end, the only question is, how long it took and how much difficulty we had.</p><p>&#160;</p>"

          " <p>Hi Suzy, I&#39;m 7 weeks &amp; only go to the PT once every 3 weeks. My main exercise I do now is walking up &amp; downstairs properly. When that is mastered ( not me yet) I will try 2 stairs at a time. Doing that helps the bends &amp; the other thing I&#39;ve been told to do is put the operated side foot on the bottom stairs &amp; lean/ push forward that really helps the bend. If I walk any distance my knee swells &amp; is painful &amp; takes me a couple of days to get over it. I think you do still have to rest leg elevated &amp; with ice, when it swells &amp; hurts I think it&#39;s telling you. We all take different times to fully recover &amp; do have to listen to what a our bodies are telling us, Feel we&#39;ll soon </p> <p>Hi Suzy,</p><p>i&#39;m 6 weeks today TKR and stiffness is still a big problem. My knee swells every time I&#39;m on it for more than a few minutes which is infuriating.</p><p>i too have a job that entails me being on my feet for 6 hours at a time and I&#39;ve only got the rest of this month off but know I won&#39;t be able to return to work at the beginning of April. I&#39;ve got my check up with my consultant on the 23rd so I&#39;m hoping he&#39;ll sign me off for at least another month.</p><p>my bend is 103 with great difficulty and a lot of pain ... feels like it just can&#39;t bend any more as it feels so tight and stiff. Worries me that it&#39;ll never be able to bend any more.</p><p>I&#39;m doing the stairs properly albeit coming down I&#39;m tending to go side wards looking very odd and ungainly.</p><p>The pain isn&#39;t as bad as it was but I&#39;m still taking all my painkillers daily otherwise I can&#39;t sleep.</p> <p>I&#39;m 7 weeks post bilateral knees replaced and I&#39;m having trouble with the bend too. My PT can get me to 110 but a lot of pain. I am still def experiencing pain and swelling which stinks!! I go back to work on 4/3 but I, thankfully, don&#39;t have to stand but sit a lot and get up and down occasionally. I&#39;m a little worried and hope I can do it. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be in pain and swollen every night for quite awhile! Damn!! I wish you luck.</p> <p>Seven to thirteen miles a day? &#160;Really? &#160;Who knows if you&#39;ll be able to handle that but it took me EIGHT MONTHS to get to 5 miles a day three days a week...and that was not easy plus being very exhausting.</p><p></p><p>Some people have been known to recover very quickly but it is not the norm...</p><p></p><p><a href=\"/forums/discuss/the-tkr-recovery-bell-curve--563756\" target=\"_blank\">https://patient.info/forums/discuss/the-tkr-recovery-bell-curve--563756</a></p><p></p><p>Swelling ALWAYS indicates that you pushed the knee too far that day. &#160;I used a FitBit to find the point at which my knee swelled, backed off and increased gradually...always monitoring my steps for the day (11,000+ steps is about 5 miles). &#160;You may want to use a pedometer of some kind to check your progress.</p><p></p><p>Remember... You cannot push this to a specific end date. &#160;You&#39;ll be done when you&#39;re done and not a moment sooner.</p> Hi suzyQ21355 it is 23 weeks and i can bend but my flexion is only 100 and should be 120 so i hope it comes but i know how you feel. I have not gone back to work yet either Hi suzi I am 5 days since tkr surgery and I have been able to walk since day 3 but now the swelling and bruising is affecting my knee bend I start pt Friday and frightened what they will do "

I don&#39;t seem to be having any trouble doing much of anything I want except for bending my knee. I&#39;m anxious to get back to work but doubt I will be able to because of the swelling and bending. My job demands me walking and standing all day. Walking anywhere from 7 to 13 miles. I&#39;m scared I won&#39;t be able to go back to work. Is anyone else having trouble with swelling and bending after 9weeks after surgery.</p>"

          " Hi I really feel for you and the situation. I am someone who has a problem with alcohol and unfortunately your BF doesn't sound as though he has admitted to himself that his drinking is a problem and truly accepted it. It is well kown that this problem doesn't go away overnight and it may take a few attempts at detox. I'm a great believer in getting to the bottom of what started the problem in the first place. I myself know what started my drinking although I still have to find a way to put it behind me. Maybe your BF needs to talk to a counsellor. Maybe you could do with talking to someone yourself and using this site is a good way of venting your fears and anxieties. Seeing other peoples point of views from both sides can be quite therapeutic. There's always someone around to speak to I wish you luck and your BF is very lucky to have a friend that worries so much for them. Maybe you could get them to register for this site they may benefit from it. Thinking of you. Sandie Hi Quadrillion , first off you cannot \"fix\" your BF only he can make the decision to quit - he certainly does not seem to want to do this right now- rehab is a waste of time unless the addict goes for the right reason - FOR THEMSEVES - addiction is a really selfish disease - alcoholics/drug addicts lie,cheat,steal and manipulate everybody around them to get what they want ( i have done all of the above) the alcohol will always come first, when he is drinking- that is all that matters to him -where is the next drink coming from - you have some hard decisions to make- sorry but there is no road map or easy way to deal with this situation - the name calling and abuse are typical, when an alcoholic doesent get his way- it will always be all about him- when he is drinking- relapse is a very common occurence for alcoholics, it can happen anytime- getting sober is relatively easy- staying sober is the real hard bit- i went through many years of relapse before i stayed sober for any length of time- you need to start looking out for yourself - now for the ugly bit- do you want to live like this, you will never know when he may relapse- never know when you will be let down- what happens if you have kids - the world of addiction is full of pain and the ones who get hurt the most are always those that are closest to the addict- do you really want to live like this- sorry but there is no point in trying to sugar coat it - i have been sober for ten years, but i still have to work everyday at it and have come close to relapse many times - you get no gaurentees with addiction - my honest advice, you cannot trust him until he has demonstrated to you he has done something about his drinking over a sustained period of time (months, not weeks) and is commited to working at staying sober - meanwhile you need to concentrate on looking after YOU - remember you are not responsible for his addiction or his recovery - DO NOT LET HIM MANIPULATE YOU INTO FEELING GUILTY ABOUT HIS SITUATION - HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ACTIONS AND MUST LEARN TO LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES- you have to be realistic - look after you and your future - his future is in his own hands- he must make the choice to get help and stop drinking - i wish you all the best - While I don't disagree with the comments from Sandie and pmcg, I do have something different to say. You (and your boyfriend) have been taken in (the the vast majority of the population) that this is a behaviour disorder and all his fault. In Rehab, he will have had to go through standing up and admitting his shame and guilt about what he has put other people through. Now, imagine for just one minute that alcohol addiction was a physical illness and is no more his fault than if he had cancer. Now imagine cancer sufferers being made to stand up and talk about what terrible people they were for having cancer. I am going to send you a link to a page on my website which explains that people who become addicted to alcohol do so because their body reacts differently to alcohol than the bodies of people who manage to control their drinking. It is a physiological differenceand it is not the fault of those people who get into difficulty. I know that it is hell for you to deal with but it would perhaps be easier if you knew about the recent research which makes it clear that alcohol problems have been treated the wrong way for many years. It would also be easier for him if he had an explanation which made him understand why he does what he does. There IS a treatment method available which has a 78% success rate compared to less than 10% success rate with traditional rehab. It is called The Sinclair Method. You will find plenty of stuff about it on this forum and also about Nalmefene and Naltrexone, the drugs used with this treatment method. Good luck Quadrillion. I really hope that you and your boyfriend find a positive way forward. Look at the private message I have sent you too."

          "I just registered for this site bc I am completely overwhelmed & dont know what to do. My BF is an alcoholic when I met him a year and a half ago I had no idea ... Thru A LOT of love time and support I got him to a three month excellent rehab out of state dualDiagnostic etc he did amazingly well only to start drinking horribly again after all the education that cost him tens of thousands of dollars the fourth month before he came home ... He finally came home through my help and was detoxed at home he was again off alcohol for a month only to start again a month later ... It has not stopped . I am SICK worried don't know what to do his family has turned their back on him - I can't let him stay with me cuz I've tried I've have done it before but I worry I won't know what to do when he starts shaking or gets sick ... I love him goes without saying and have and will do ANYTHING to help. But he can't stay with me. spo the last time he was detoxed about a month ago i took hinm to a hotel - I Am worried sick cuz in the last two weeks since i have seen him - he has said I'm selfish cuz he's spending so much money on hotels and although I know I'm the farthest thing from selfish I can understand why he feels this way but i have tried the scenario of his living with me and he just continues on the same destructive path -he needs professional help . The last time I saw him was two weeks ago now from us being together pratically every day, nornign and night - this is heartbreaking. I keep hearing the same thing from him that I'm selfish that I'll die alone cuz I'm selfish calling me everything you can imagine ... I never say anything mean back only lift him up with positives and every day try to suggest to him that we go to yet another detox then Rehab ... he said he wanted to see me in the last couple of weeks but he was drinking and I just couldn't do it for my sanity so I told him I was working which was true ... Now in the past day and a half he's gone from text maybe 3 a day (from being together all the time ) and now nasty vile vulgar texts to me and about me two days ago ... It is a complete switch so I don't know where he is for the first time since ive known him - he has sent me videos of himslef and he looks horrible pale white and so drunk its awful .. I am at the brink of tears every day and am so worried .. I do not like Al anon at all there's no discussion there only talking and then a \"thank you for sharing\" it's not for me. Please please please give me guidance I am desperate what to do why has gone from a million texts a day to hardly anything ... Is it becuz i have been askign him to go to detox and he doesnt want to hear it and so he is pushing me away becuz i represnt sanity and the \"right thing\" - or is it beciz i havent said yes yet agin to his living with me which is what he seems to be so angry about - he wont stop bringing it up = I HAD TO take a break cuz my mental health was at risk not to mention all the time I have missed with my Work I was at risk of losing everything .Will he regret hwo he is treating me when and if he sobers up - is my staying away smear or will he resent me for it - He always spoke of getting married and we were the perfect couple - . Please respond"

          "  Hi Joan, I enjoyed reading ur very positive accessment of TKR surgery. Very well described the life and times of a recovering TKR . ^_ October will be here soon and then u must let us know how u r doin? A lot of us genuinely care and appreciate all the support we give & receive. Thanks for sharing.:))  Thank you so much for that' After I went for my pre op assessment yesterday I was beginning to feel like backing out. I think it was because of not being able to drive more than anything. My husband can't drive until December because of a stroke so we'll be really stuck. Especially as the leaflet from the hospital said at least two months before I could drive and the family are miles away. I'll make sure that I do everything I can to get back on my feet and the the road. Without overdoing it of course.  Thanks, Joan, that's really helpful to hear that there is light at the end of the tunnel \ud83d\ude0a I am just over 3 weeks post op and am still suffering pain and stiffness but can tell that my leg is getting stronger. I go for my first session of physio back at the hospital today and wonder if I'll be given some harder exercises. I manage the ones I was given initially quite well now so am expecting to suffer a bit! I'm not sure if I'll be driving at 6 weeks - that's very impressive! I find sleeping for any length of time difficult as I wake up sore and stiff. Hope that gets better? When did you manage without crutches? I admire you getting 2nd knee done \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a well said joan , prety much the same ,now 10 post opp with knee no 2 and its very different to the first , with the end result being the same i hope  Thank you so much I am in my 7th week still some stiffness but doing good have hard time standing in one spot for awhile more like ache down in the back of knee near calf "

          "Hello everyone I just thought it might be helpful for some of you who are at the start of this long jouney back to fitness to share some of my experiences. Hope it helps. When I first came out of hospital I thought the pain was tremendous and over the first few weeks wondered why I had gone through this. I was very weepy and tired all day long. Some days I had to really push myself to do anything let alone excercise. By week three although still in pain the intensity lessened and I was able to do more. I think this spurred me on. Once I had hit the six week mark I now could drive and went in my car with glee. Must admit it was very painful braking but oh the joy of getting out under ones own steam without having to rely on people. There have been good days and bad days but have had to be patient. I am now at week 18 and realise that I am not continually thinking about my knee. My life is nearly back to normal. So ther is light at the end of the tunnel. I am due to have my other knee done in October. I have kept a weekly journel so I will know where I am up to. Hope this helps people because I hasve been helped so much on here and wanted to give something back."

          " <p>Hi:&#160; Before I attempt to answer some of your questions,<em> </em>I want to know why this is included in your text?</p><p></p><p>What&#39;s your&#160;favourite&#160;flavour&#160;of ice cream?&#160;</p><p></p><p>Thanx</p><p></p><p>&#160;</p> <p>Hi SullyTheWiz, I can&#39;t believe how much you have and are going through, it puts my anxiety and depression into some sort of perspective.&#160;</p><p>You need to see a phychiatrist as it is clear, to me anyways, that you are suffering from severe depression and which hadn&#39;t been treated properly and anxiety.&#160;</p><p>Depression and especially anxiety can cause a host of digestive problems due to the sheer number of nerve endings in the digestive system, when I started with my most recent relapse I experienced unbearable stomach pains which I thought was ibs but my dr said it was as a result if anxiety. I took peppermint tablets (prescribed) and the cramps went.</p><p>All symptoms can be put down to anxiety and depression, your pre disposition to overthinking has been hijacked by it.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;s time to go back to basics and try to find an anti depressant that you can cope with in terms of side effects, I guess your quite reluctant to give them a go but you didn&#39;t give them time previously.</p><p>You need to give yourself the opportunity to rest as best you can, forget the exercise advise for now although it is important to try and keep your brain active by doing crosswords or something however simple.&#160;</p><p>CBT will be a waste of time at the moment it&#39;s proper psychotherapy which is needed.</p><p>Chocolate ice cream btw!</p><p>I really don&#39;t know what advise I can give you other than get the help of a psychiatrist and take whatever medication they suggest, you will get side effects but they wear off, you never know in a coup,e of months things may start to fall back into place for you.</p><p>I really feel for you, I do, and I really want things to improve as it sounds like your going through hell, your resolve is amazing and you must be very strong to go through this.</p><p>Please keep us updated on what your doing, what you decide abd how you are doing, we care!&#160;</p><p>Neil&#160;</p> <p>Hi there, when I was 17/18 I had the worst anxiety possible. I didn&#39;t know that though. I had no idea what was wrong. These things weren&#39;t talked about in the same way they are now (&#39;Im 41 btw).&#160;</p><p></p><p>Anyway, it went on for months and months and eventually cleared (mostly) after nearly a year or so. I wish I had been treated as I have continued to have problems.</p><p></p><p>My symptoms at the time were: racing heart and palpatations; feeling spaced out; not quite there (depersonalization I suppose); really fuzzy head; bad headaches; ears feeling &#39;full&#39;; rigid neck muscles (I could barely turn my head); really bad health anxiety; couldn&#39;t walk properly - it was like I couldn&#39;t move one of my legs. That&#39;s all I can remember for sure but there was probably more.&#160;</p><p></p><p>I would suggest relaxation techniques and sticking with the CBT. That&#39;s because I haven&#39;t had a great time on anti-depressants, but maybe you might find one that helps.&#160;</p><p></p><p>And btw, i constantly ponder human existence and society, etc! I see nothing odd in that :)</p><p></p><p>Best wishes X</p><p></p><p>&#160;</p> <p>Hi there</p><p></p><p>You are clearly extremely articulate and intelligent, to the point of almost being obsessional about your health. I can completely relate, and have had very similar experiences with anxiety, sleep deprivation and a mental breakdown after a head injury and post concusison syndrome, coupled with severe adverse reaction to antipsychotic drugs that were given to me after my breakdown. This left me with a permanent movement disorder called tardive dyskinesia and unfortuntately, there is no cure.</p><p></p><p>I can recount exactly how I felt in the grips of sleep deprivation nearly 18 months ago. I suffered so severely that I didn&#39;t sleep completely for about two weeks (I&#39;m not joking) and as a result, suffered a very severe mental breakdown. The only think that saved me was Citalopram. I was, like you, prescribed many differeny psychotropic drugs including diazepam and zopiclone, none of which worked very well at all. My anxiety and adrenaline levels were so sky high that even the most potent antipsyhotic wasn&#39;t very effective. Believe me when I tell you that I NEVER want to go through such awful sleep deprivation ever again, nor do I want to experience that level of anxiety again either.</p><p></p><p>You are most welcome to private message me for a full account of my experience, and what helped/hindered me, and how I overcame all my debilitating symptoms. It has taken me nearly two years from my head injury to recover to what I would say is functioning on a 98% previous level, but even with my movement disorder, I am nowhere near as bad as I was in the grips of my breakdown.</p><p></p><p>Please trust me when I say that the right medication and lifestyle (CBT, exercise, diet etc) combination WILL work and help you recover. These are the only things that made me better.</p><p></p><p>You WILL get better and recover. You CAN do this. After all I&#39;ve been through - and honestly, it is pretty awful - I can recover, and I have every faith that you will too.</p><p></p><p>Please message me, I&#39;d like to help you more.</p><p></p><p>Stay strong. :-)</p>"

          "<p>Hi all &#160;I&#39;m a first time user of this site. Apologies in advance for the extremely long post but I feel that providing as much information as possible in anecdotal form is better than bullet points as of now. Please let me know if I have to post elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>The last 5 months have seen my life do a complete 180, to the point where as of this post I am barely able to function; the only thing keeping me going is my intellect.</p><p></p><p>Context:</p><p>I have slept poorly in the last few years through no fault other than my own, leading me to gradually feel depersonalized over the years- though it was still manageable and not detrimental to my day. I was always a person with an incredibly sharp memory and had the ability to multitask effortlessly. I was always a high achiever in school/college and had an interest in many, many topics. Sometime near the end of last&#160;year&#160;I was low on self-esteem/appearance so I decided to lose weight in order to feel better about myself. However, I did so (rapidly) in a rather unhealthy manner, and while I felt the best I had ever felt during&#160;those times-I&#160;was really athletic but would&#160;overexcercise&#160;and&#160;undersleep- I took it too far with a poor diet and the taking of supplements- some of which were high in caffeine and eventually led to my first hospital visit for heart palpitations-where I was told that I needed to up my caloric intake. However, this led to my self-control that I possessed completely collapsing and I started to binge snack.</p><p></p><p>From then on it was a downward spiral, with the continuation of overexertion and poor sleep leading to me one day waking up on a college day completely exhausted and unable to go to college. From then on I started to experience &quot;brain fog&quot; and an inability to concentrate. My inquisitions at this point&#160;were&#160;focused on organic causes for these symptoms and led me to find many explanations as to why I felt this way&#160;including:&#160;Vitaming&#160;B12 deficiency, Mold in my room(!), Dehydration etc</p><p>&#160;At this&#160;point&#160;I was rather stressed, especially regarding my University applications and missed exams etc. I had also developed an incredible headache that was really excruciating and provided great discomfort.&#160;</p><p>None of my solutions worked so I went to the doctor, who diagnosed me as depressed and prescribed with 50mg Sertraline. Unfortunately, I was curious at that time as to what the possible side effects would be-BIG MISTAKE. The nitwit of a doctor told me that the only side effect that I&#39;d experience was indigestion;&#160;however&#160;my stupid&#160;self knew&#160;that wasn&#39;t the case. Going home, I was put&#160;off&#160;the medication for a week when I saw things like &quot;shortness of breath&quot; and &quot;racing heartbeat&quot; listed as side effects.&#160;However&#160;my headache only worsened and I was left with no choice but to take the Sertraline. At this&#160;point&#160;I was not anxious but a little annoyed. The next day I had some mild SE such as jaw locking etc; nothing of much concern. The 2nd&#160;night however&#160;left me UNABLE to sleep, so I stayed up until the morning. The pressure in my head felt unbearable, and I found myself slurring&#160;with&#160;my speech and collapsing momentarily.</p><p>A hospital stay and a CT scan later found no abnormalities, and I was told to &quot;stop making your parents worry&quot; (thanks&#160;NHS!)</p><p>My adverse reaction made me discontinue the Sertraline after 3 days(safe)</p><p>However the next day saw me unable to sleep again, but this time I was shaking involuntarily with my teeth chattering. Calling the ambulance (2nd time) brought me to my G.P who prescribed me with 2mg Diazepam 2x daily to help with the seemingly vicious cycle of anxiety that was emerging-great! now the burden of a possible addictive drug in addition to my problems was present-</p><p>I&#39;m not going to lie, I felt EUPHORIC as hell upon taking Diazepam; my stupidly sensitive body was dumbed down by&#160;only&#160;2mg (lol) and I could see why people become addicted. The anxiety manifested itself into constant surges of adrenaline (especially through my right arm) and rapid heart rates until I would take the medication and it would&#160;dissapear. Unfortunately, a week into this and I started to experience bad side effects. For one, I became a bit paranoid that my&#160;bedsheets&#160;were going to be ripped off through the night (by whom, my cat?), felt like a sluggish zombie, but worst of all I experienced short term memory loss/inabillity&#160;to form them. My sleep was also worsening as a result of the anxiety, yet I was still emotionally stable. I tapered off of the Diazepam succesfully&#160;but my headaches and fog grew worse. At this time I started to become sleep deprived. The doctor upon hearing my cries prescribed me with&#160;Mirtazipine&#160;15mg (ANOTHER antidepressant) and&#160;Zopicolone&#160;2mg (to help me sleep). I asked the buffoon whether I could take Neurozan&#160;multivitamins&#160;with the medication as I wasn&#39;t really consuming much due to poor sleep cycle and appetite. He.said.yes.</p><p>The Zopiclone left me feeling more depersonalized than I ever have been; a complete zombie devoid of any personality. I woke up questioning the purpose of existence (what are humans? Why do we shop? Purpose of a&#160;hierarchial&#160;structure?)</p><p>However, that wasn&#39;t the worst bit. Shortly after taking Neurozan (which contains 5-HTP; a precursor to the production of SEROTONIN) I experienced Serotonin Syndrome, which could have been dangerous had there been more 5-HTP. Jerking, anger, agitation, temperature etc. Calling the ambulance AGAIN led them to again mention mental health (though at this time it was a physical issue)</p><p>So, of&#160;course&#160;I stopped the medication. All the while, I was still struggling to set up appointments with a Psychiatrist from&#160;Forward&#160;thinking. Once we did, I gave him my life story up to that point and he stupidly asked&#160;</p><p>&quot;What would you like to get out of this service?&quot;&#160;</p><p>Bloody hell. We concluded that I had severe health anxiety and I was not to Google symptoms, as WebMD and even <a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\">Patient.info</a> is a&#160;hyperchondriac&#39;s&#160;worst nightmare.</p><p>However, my overwhelming urge to find out what was wrong ruined me, and there were times when I thought I fit the bill for Creutzdfelt-Jakob disease (both sporadic and beef version) and that I was going to die soon and degenerate brain-wise.</p><p>This anxiety died down as I got annoyed about the plethora of conditions that matched my symptoms; some &quot;red flag&quot; and some common- from MS to cJD&#160;etc.</p><p>One that stuck, in a rational way, was Lyme&#39;s/tick-borne disease. Not because of my health paranoia but because I had been in the country (Peak District) etc many times and had been bitten by ticks many times-especially in&#160;high&#160;grass wearing shorts.&#160;</p><p>Still, I suffered as my general anxiety became worse and I felt a near-constant feeling of adrenaline that would leave me exhausted after it subsided. My sleep was becoming more and more disrupted to the point where I went my first 24-hours without sleeping. How on earth did that guy who broke the world record sleep for 11-days straight?!</p><p>Nevertheless, from now my sleep/wake cycle and my body clock had started to get bashed (to put it bluntly) and I was now sleeping during the day, and being awake at night. Weirdly, I was fine with this-maybe because I didn&#39;t care and maybe because it was peaceful in the night :)&#160;</p><p>However, the coming days saw persistent anxiety attacks as well as sleep drunkenness, until ONE DAY. A day which, following another sleep deprived 28-hours, I felt LOW. Subhuman. Hard to describe but I was in an Abyss. I knew that something was wrong. This is probably what it felt like to have depleted chemicals or whatever severe depression was like. Little did I know, it was only going to get worse.</p><p>I slumped into severe&#160;depression,&#160;and was feeling the brunt force of it. I felt slow, dumbed down, and my cognitive&#160;impairement&#160;was evident through my own introspection. I could not focus on ANYTHING/process information/remember things/multitask/perceive reality/co-ordinate&#160;myself at all. This was SCARY. In addition, there was Psychomotor Retardation; funny term but it turned me into a blob; slowing-down my thought processes and reducing my physical movements- my legs felt like bricks, any action that I thought of was completed not instantly but with delay. &quot;This is&#160;hell&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;Pure, utter hell&quot;. This&#160;physcial&#160;inabillity, let me rephrase that, LITERAL INABILITY to move acted in direct contrast to the innocent/well-meaning but moronic advice I was given by doctors and my family members. &quot;YOU should&#160;excercise&#160;and walk outside more, trust me you&#39;ll get better&quot;.</p><p>Had I not been so understanding of my condition and avoided hypochondriac reasoning I would have suffered even more. This is more like a &#39;wear the t-shirt experience&#39; and I strongly urge to anyone reading this: mild-moderate depression and its solutions cannot be applied to those with severe depression. Severe depression is a literal disability that destroys you, and those with uneducated families will suffer.&#160;Heck&#160;my biggest suffering came from the cognitive/physical effects of the depression rather than emotional.&#160;</p><p>Moving on, I was at a crossroads. I felt the worst I had ever felt in my life. I woke up one night with passive [b]suicidal[/b] thoughts- something I had never experienced in my life. If I would put it simply, it was as if I was being controlled by a faulty machine; lured by the prospect of death with a seemingly bad taste in my mouth.</p><p>My perceptual awareness, informational understanding, and memory had turned to shreds. However, I seemingly found hope. Not willing to suffer more through medication(even though in reality, I had never given them a chance to really take effect) led me to accidentally stumble across a new treatment: rTMS. Standing for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (it scared me at first because I thought it was like ECT) it promoted a jump-start effect of the brain rather than the plaster effect that antidepressants have because unlike SSRIs this treatment promoted the growth of new neuronal connections and therefore the growth of neurotransmitters such as serotonin,&#160;dopamine&#160;and norepinephrine on the left prefrontal cortex of the brain (area that is low in activity in people with depression)</p><p>It seemed like I found hope; it had a higher efficacy than&#160;antidepressant, little-to-no perceived side effects and was longer lasting and non-invasive. Perfect!</p><p>However, the online responses were mixed; many saying that it was a waste of time while a news article claimed it had saved a [b]suicidal[/b] man from severe depression. Extensive research proved that I had the benefit of the doubt because of my age and my developing brain (I&#39;m 18) and because I had such a caring family, the price tag (which I&#39;ll admit is far too expensive and should be more readily affordable) of &#163;1250 a week was not an issue, so there I went.</p><p>I was an anxious mess before the first procedure, which felt uncomfortable and slightly painful at first. The first few days were awful. I seemed to have rapid-cycling mood changes after the first treatments, and I was still&#160;feeing&#160;low. BY the 7th, I felt much calmer and the feeling of constant adrenaline had subsided, my sleep and appetite had been improved and I finally managed to reset my body clock. In addition, I also began having flashbacks of random memories that I hadn&#39;t remembered in quite a while, while also remembering the faces of many people I hadn&#39;t seen for years. Weird.</p><p>Still, I was getting physically worse, my immune system had taken a big toll and my digestive system even more so. I felt more and&#160;more foggy&#160;as the days wore on and could not accurately remember faces. I also supposedly had a fungal infection of the mouth. My digestive issues worsened to the point that I had constant acid reflux and would constantly go to the toilet. This was managed initially by Gaviscon/Ranitidine but when worsened I was told that I had Gastroenteritis when going to the hospital. Well done doc, I have not been persistently vomiting nor have I had persistent diarrhoea (pardon my&#160;hypochondriasis:)) .&#160;Nevertheless&#160;I went home and was told the basics (fluid intake etc)</p><p>Weirdly enough, my anxiety came back and my depression worsened by the 12th treatment (maybe it was a dip that is common in rTMS) though that seems to have improved again.</p><p>However, my digestive issues escalated to another level, intense pain under my rib that radiated to my back, while my throat was seemingly still leaving me unable to swallow properly-able to eat food but not able to swallow. A subsequent visit&#160;to the hospital (again) led them to suspect a potential gallstone (I&#160;have&#160;been eating a lot of fatty foods recently). In addition, my gait seemed to have changed, while the right side of my body in particular(arm) feels numb and not as sensitive as before. Weird movements in my bowels that made me feel like death were&#160;a constant. I could feel as though my spine was slightly arching over (bad posture?)</p><p>and it was causing me great pain and making my fog worse. This then led to decreased sensitivity throughout my entire body-scratching my body felt weird.&#160;</p><p>Adding to the hellfire, I started to experience blotches in my vision; the little worms that were an annoying ever-present but made me concerned. The back pain for an 18-year old who was previously highly active is unusual, but for&#160;this&#160;I have decided to see a chiropractor on Thursday (fingers crossed that it could be a resolvable problem there) but I am now at another crossroads. I can sense that my thought processes and perceptions are not those of the normal me, and are quite irrational but also abnormal in the way that I see negativity in everything; even extending so far as to think that there&#39;s no point of working hard to get a job etc when I&#39;m better. I am undergoing CBT, though that was originally intended to help me deal with anxiety management techniques, I still feel hopeless. I am in my 4th week of treatment but have had to suspend it because I feel barely functional in almost all aspects except for my language and comprehension, and am suffering from an unknown problem regarding my digestive organs.&#160;</p><p>I am intrigued as to what will show up if I decide to have a PET scan of my brain (shows brain activity). I don&#39;t&#160;belive&#160;that it will fuel any anxiety, rather it may give me an insight as to why I feel like a blob. I have gained so much weight since, so I am a blob as of now.</p><p></p><p>I believe that the human psyche and human body has its limits, and if those are damaged then it can alter a person&#39;s view of the world. I thank whoever reads this post (literally the first time I have EVER written on the internet but I feel as though I have to seek help as my suffering has not only drastically impacted my quality of life but also my family&#39;s (who have had to endure me constantly re-educating them on the human psyche and biology). I have said to countless nurses etc that after all I&#39;ve been through, it would be stupid for me not to contribute greatly to the mental health industry/research as I have learned too much! Being a Psychology student at A-Level, I really thought that depression was only &quot;a psychological disorder characterized by persistent sadness (2marks)&quot;</p><p></p><p>To cut it short :)</p><p>What do you suspect is wrong? (Overthinking shouldn&#39;t be a thing because I have always been like that)</p><p>Which specialist should I see?</p><p>What&#39;s your&#160;favourite&#160;flavour&#160;of ice cream?</p><p>Did my depression cause these digestive&#160;issues,&#160;or vice versa?</p><p></p><p>Symptoms:</p><p>-Heavy cognitive impairment in most areas (perceptual awareness, coordination, problem-solving, concentration, memory/recall, environmental detection)</p><p>-Weakness and Numbness in the majority of my body</p><p>-Brick-like feeling in my head</p><p>-Difficulty walking and back pain</p><p>-Unknown digestive issues with intense abdominal pain, especially under rib</p><p>-Blotches in my vision all the time (worms)</p><p>-Extreme depersonalization (not so much like an anxiety attack, more like the world isn&#39;t real)</p><p>-Seemingly arched spine (I&#39;m serious! it&#39;s uncomfortable and I can feel it when lying down)</p><p>-Weird perception of reality and human existence</p><p>-Abnormal gait</p><p>-Heaviness to right side of the body</p><p>-Weakness in facial muscles (eyebrows)</p><p>-Frequent desire to use the toilets</p><p>-Blocked feeling in ears</p><p>-Dizziness upon standing up</p><p>-Eyes hurting</p><p></p><p>For those that have stuck till the end, thank you, your support means so much to me. I just want my old life back. I want to be able to enjoy playing video games, football, solving complex puzzles etc.</p><p>&#160;</p>"

          " To me this sounds like either vestibular migraines or a physical problem such as a pinched nerve/slipped disk/curvature issue in your cervical area. Both have very similar symptoms. I will say that the one thing you listed that wouldn't fit is your problems with your stomach. Constant dizziness and headaches typically lead to nausea but I don't want you mean when you talk about a balloon. If the MRI and CT scans come back clear, you can expect to be sent to an ENT for testing. If that is clear I would suggest going to massage therapist or chiropractor for an x ray. Any issues with yiur eyes should be an immediate visit with an opthamologist. Period. I have optic nerve pallor and pvd in right eye. No cure as yet for the optic nerve and they are watching it it has messed with my head. Scary now but i try to be positive. Pvd they have remidies and such.. Dont dismiss that stuff. Let the opthamologist deciede if its something to ignore. They are very trained and i feel this is a good idea for you.  my daughter has symptoms similar to your with the dizzyness and the things floating in her eyes the black spots and muscle and all over body pain and she has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. she also has quite low blood pressure. have you had your blood pressure checked. i dont know about your stomach. also dizzyness can be caused by ear problems. as our ears affect our balance. i do hope that you can find out what is wrong and things get better. its the worst thing when we are feeling very ill and get all those tests and they come back normal. its very upsetting. as we are left worrying and that in itself causes even more problems like tense muscles. she also has the problem of bright lights and wears sunglasses a lot of the time as she cant stand the light. i hope and pray that you get some answers and relief.

          "Hello everybody, If you haven't read my last post please do as this one is a continuation of my last one... So since my last post I have gotten worst, but before telling you guys my new symptoms let me just say that I haven't seen a neurologist yet but I do have an appointment schedule. So about my new symptoms: One day I woke up, with what seems to be like 50 \"things\" floating in my \"vision\" in my the right eye and some black spots and every day they increase number, they dont stop me from seeing but its annoying to have things floating around, Also Im having A LOT of difficulty looking up, it just makes me super dizzy, it makes me lose my balance and It makes me feel as my eyes are going to pop of my head. Im also experiencing ligth sensitive, if I look at a window or a lamp my eyes will just start burning. My dizziness and balance was also gotten worse, Im falling everywhere! And it takes just a simple movement like standing up to stay super dizzy and fall. Im also having problems with my stomach as it feels like a ballon is in there! And also my headaches are getting A LOT worst, im having these horrible pain in the sides of my head where it seems like someone is stabbing me! I decided to make a second post to see If I could get more opinions of people as of what these could be... So please if you have any ideia repost to these post, Thank you so much"

          " Hi, I don't have much I can offer in terms of knowledge, but an wondering how you are getting on? I am having similar symptoms & have no idea why or what is causing it. It is out of character for me Hi Twinky, sorry you're feeling like this too. I still don't know what is wrong. I had the MRI last week and went to see the Neurologist yesterday, the appointment didn't go that well as I found it quite difficult explaining how I feel. She didn't have the MRI results, so when she does I will know a bit more. The thing I found most difficult was I tried to explain my symptoms. For example I told her I had been finding writing difficult, making mistakes etc, so she asked me to write my name and then said that it looked fine, I said yes but I know my name, I can do things I know, I think she understood me a bit better then, but its a uphill struggle when you dont understand things yourself, trying to explain things in a way someone else can understand. What symptoms do you have? I have been noticing 'brain fog' in general for about 6m now & I have been struggling with my handwriting...just holding my pen feels odd & letter formation isn't great. I try to type as much as I can, but I find myself spelling things wrong & unable to think of the words I want. I'm always saying the wrong things in sentences & have noticed my sequencing is off. When writing Christmas cards last week I found myself putting names in the wrong order & worrying I might have written happy birthday instead of happy Christmas! I feel quite detached from things going on around me at times too & am occasionally worried about this when it comes on when I'm driving. It's all so unlike me. I'm also increasingly irritable. I've also lost interest in tv as I find I'm not able to concentrate & follow what's going on Thats exactly how I feel. I tried to write a letter to the insurance company recently, and I kept making mistakes, putting the wrong word, or thinking that I put the wrong word and having to recheck. The pen felt strange to hold, like awkward. I also had difficulty picking up a jar of coins I dropped accidentally, I did get them all, but it felt as though it didnt come naturally, and it was frustrating. I find it hard to watch TV, I lose track as my concentration drifts, it also does it when I am taking to people and I feel so rude when I realise I havent heard a word they said. I can do this 4 or 5 times a day and sometimes have to fight to continue concentrating, How is your co ordination? I have become clumbsy and am finding judging doorways etc difficult and knock into them by accident sometimes, this is worse when I have had to concentrate or I am tired. I'm not sure if I would say I feel detached, I feel like I am here and involved, but like I have a bad flu that only involves my brain (like a headcold). I have also noticed my neck is achy most of the time. What did your doctor think it could be when you saw them? I haven't noticed anything with my coordination it's more the ordering of my thoughts & listening, recalling & recording that are effected. I feel restless at times too & hard to switch off. I'm also irritable but I think that's probably be user in not sleeping very well (waking in the night) & have small children so never get my natural requirement of sleep, plus I am worried about why I feel this way. I have noticed that I occasionally get a numbness in my fingers tips too (they go white), it only last a minute or two but is odd. Not sure if its related or not. I've only just approached by Gp a couple if weeks ago. Initially she concentrated on the restlessness & prescribed propanolol for anxiety but I haven't really taken them as I think I didn't describe the problem well. I went back again after writing down all of the concerns I had in bullet point & she is running hormone & thyroid bloods & also other bloods as I said I was worried it may be something sinister. I have another appointment on Monday to go through the results & plan from there. A brain scan, referral to neurologist & memory clinic have all been mentioned, but awaiting the blood results 1st. When did you have your scan? Did they say what they would be looking for? Or when results would be? Is your sleep & mood ok? I haven't had any numbness in my fingers but they get very cold quickly and my feet too, much more than they used to, that could just be age though (although I'm not really old at 39) Sleep has been fine go to bed around 10pm and wake at 7am, which is strange as I have never slept that well in the past! my mood ok although worried like you said, which is only natural I suppose. The doctor thought it was either thyroid or menapause untill the bloods came back ok, then she tested minerals vitamins and adrenals, they were all fine. She also mentioned the memory clinic as an option although I dont think that will be useful as my memory is not totally gone, its ok one minute (not perfect but I can manage to do basic tasks etc). The scan was last Saturday and they were looking for signs of MS/tumour etc. I think MS shows as lesions on the scan, and they can rule it out quite easily (hopefully). I think the results will be in a week or 2, I have seen the neurologist yesterday but unfortunately she didnt have the results yet. If you do need to have the MRI if you havent had one before, there is a video on you tube of the sounds the scanner makes, watch it before hand! Its a shock otherwise, I had no idea how weird it would be :) I can relate to much of this. I know it sounds silly but I haven't had it checked out as I was afraid of a diagnosis of dementia. That said I know the tests and think I would have sailed through them. It was just a load of things, getting a penalty because I forgot to get a ticket in the pay and display, leaving the car window open, going upstairs for the ironing board then realising I had.brought down the stepladders, writing the same item twice in a shopping list, leaving my purse at a checkout, having the wrong words come out in conversation, putting things away in strange places..... Then there was the new job. I was struggling to take in information and every night I used to come home and make notes. It was really difficult but I struggled on because I enjoyed the work.. When the work situation changed I found myself getting stressed and making mistakes so I left. I was also getting some morning dizziness. I'm almost back to 'normal' now and I think I know what was wrong.. I had been operating my solid fuel stove with the door open on an evening and discovered I had been getting a constant low level dose of carbon monoxide. This would perhaps explain the morning symptoms and occasional headache at night. It is not confirmed but excessive stress and depression can hamper normal brain functioning.Because it needs a great concentration to memorize something. Thanks How did you get in with the MRI results? Otherwise What natural approaches have you tried? Once you've been checked out medically, you could try: 1. Nutrients eg b vitamin formula and fish oil. 2. Brainwave entrainment meditation - have a look at active minds global website 3. Regular cardio exercise such as power walking, running, gym etc  Sorry I haven't been back to update, I completely forgot that I started the thread, and the only alert I recieved was the last one by scottiej. My scan was normal and I had a follow up appointment with the neuro 1st April, this was cancelled and put back untill 25th June! So I went back to the GP and told him that although I am much better, I am still not 100%. He said it could be my ears and refered me to ENT, I had the appointment the other day, he said my balance is out when my eyes are closed, so I need to have another MRI focusing on my ears this time. I have started taking a good multi vitamin 2 months ago, I thought it couldn't hurt, but not fish oil, so will look into that too, thanks.Exersize is a hard one, because I did try going to the gym and it made me very dizzy particularly the running machine and cross trainer which are the only 2 machines I enjoy. Walking is ok and I do walk alot. I have never heard of brainwave, so will have a look thanks for that :) Ask for a vitamin b12 blood test. Your symptoms seem typical of vit b12 deficiency I dont know what to say... I am feeling the exact way what all are feeling in here. plzz help me as you all know what a pain it causes, help me. *I dont feel reality anymore, every thing seems illusion....  Hi again, Just wanted to update you. I just had a letter from the consultant with the latest MRI results back today, and they have found a small cystic area right temple/ madibular joint area, they want to look more closely and I have a CT scan in 3 days. It's such a relief to know that these symptoms do have a cause! I hope anyone else suffering like this finds out what is wrong, the worst part is the not knowing :( *Wrong words coming out during verbal conversations. I don't even hear, the other person notices it. *signature does not comes the same, forgetting the hand stroke *forgetting mobile phone on the lap, quickly standing and realising it was on my lap *short term memory loss *extreme hair loss *lack of concentration *decreasing capacity on analytical problem solving *loosing things and not remembering where I put them *tripping or knocking things, difficulty in estimating distance *holding items and droppping them * "

          "Hi, I am wondering if anyone can help me, I have no idea what is wrong, but I feel like I am going slightly mad! Upto 6 months ago I was fine, I work for a search engine from home, and its hard but I love it. The first thing I noticed was making silly mistakes, spelling and grammar, things I have always known, I was looking at a word I was so sure was correct, and it would be later when I happened to notice it was spelt wrong or the wrong word all together. This carried on for a few months, not getting worse or better, and I also noticed at this point my hair is falling out. Then 3mths ago I started feeling like my head is full of cotton wool, I found it hard to concentrate and listen to people, sometimes I can't remember simple instructions even though I try hard to remember and repeat things to myself, the cotton wool feeling is still there today. Sometimes I remember things other times its just blank, its worse when I'm tired. I went to the doctor when I started making more mistakes at work, and my hair loss is very noticable, she saw me 8 months previously and my hair is at least 50% less. The doctor has done a number of blood tests and they all came back normal including thyroid, adrenal gland and hormones (menopause). The doctor seems concerned and I have a MRI scan of the brain in 3 weeks, and an appointment with a neurologist a week after that. I still feel 'foggy, tired, no concentration' but otherwise I am happy, I am not stressed (I am lucky that I dont need to work, I do it as I enjoy it), What could she be looking for with the scan? Does anyone have any ideas what it could be? Thanks"

          " I do not drink, smoke, I do not drink coffee or tea (if I do it's pure peppermint)  Hi there, I get waves of dizziness too. Its a co-incidence you mention looking down because I have had this problem too. It feels like I am falling and quickly have to stop myself. This only lasts for a few sseconds too but it makes me jump all the same. I get it in bed as well. Feels like I am either moving to the side all of a sudden or like things are spinning inside my head and it always happens all of a sudden! I have already posted on this site about dizziness during take off and landing in a plane. Also I think I mentioned waking in bed one morning severely dizzy! Never been as scared. Yet that only lasted 30 seconds. Thing is you think it wont stop dont you. But it always does. So yes I experience this minor dizzy episodes and I think they mostly started with the severe one in bed about 5 years ago. Doc told me that was BPPV. Hey smiles, I think that I am leaning more towards bppv as well. Sounds very similar to my story. My ENT's originally diagnoses was labyrinthitus. I went back to see her and now she is insure so she gave me a referral to a neurologist. Waiting on that appointment. I have done eye tests, MRI with the injection, couple doctors visits, blood work, blah blah blah. Everything came back normal. One of the original doctors I visited said that she thinks it's bppv. Maybe I should start doing exercises for my ears now. Have been thinking possible migraines as my ENT pointed out that potential diagnoses. She also said that it could be a pinched nerve in my neck. Who knows I just dont understand... I knew vertigo (which they are guessing) with tinnuitis comes and goes but holy... a week in Nov, twice in Dec.. Jan and Feb pretty much straight then thought I was better.. spins and dizzy gone just this falling feeling, or almost like a headrush only dizzy.. quick.. standing, laying.. dont matter what Im doing it just happens quick and gone... very tired the past couple of days..  It might be worth asking for a referral to a neurologist for an MRI scan, just to rule out any neuro causes. The only other things which I know about are Meniere's Disease which might fit with what you describe, or labyrinthitis. Hope this helps, but I am no expert, just someone who has experienced dizziness and labyrinthitis. It would cost you about \u00a3500-600 to see a neurologist privately I think, and that's if you needed private MRI scan. I did this due to another neurological problem which has now been fixed. Good luck Smiles.  I have an eye exam in week to cross that off.. waiting on ENT in May.. on cancellation list... am hoping if nothing than the ENT will do MRI.. I hate that vertigo etc cant be diagnosed w/out guessing.. Hello Dizziness has been the bane of my life for almost 16 months now. Ive managed to get myself back to work but its been a real struggle and some days I barely know how I make it through the day. I too have these little half second dizzy zaps, mine feel like someone has grabbed the back of my head and they are pushing me forward and sometimes I feel like im leaning to one side or my feet are sinking into the floor. My head zaps also tend to happen either when Im looking down or up or sometimes when I move my head but not all the time. When I was first diagnosed with BPPV I was getting about 50 of these per day and all my GP had to say was 'that sounds nasty, i wouldn't like to have that'! I saw an ENT consultant last April and again in January this year to be told that I had had BPPV but now Im left with psychological vertigo due to hypersensitivity to movement and anxiety. Doctors dont seem to see the wider picture with inner ear conditions. I was told that I would be 100% better in 10 weeks max even without treatment and yet here I am almost a year and a half down the line and I still feel well below par and feeling off balance and faint most days. Because of this ive developed a serious health anxiety and have pretty much convinced myself that something really bad is going on with my health. There seems to be no answers and not much help out there for inner ear dizziness. My confidence has hit an all time low, I go to work, food shopping, which is a nightmare due to panic attacks, and then I go home and thats been my life for the last year and I hate it. I dont go out, I dont see my friends and even some of my family anymore. I want my life back but the medical profession arent listening. Im sorry for the rant but its been a bad day and Im feeling particularily low today. Lisa, that sounds absolutely awful. I've not had even a fraction of your problems and yet I know how unpredictable dizziness can affect you. Really feel for you and do hope that you may be able to get some answers by perhaps going privately? I've also experienced this withdrawal from normal life and friendships due to another neurological condition and I know how emotionally blunting it can be. I am very lucky in having had surgery (brain!) and am now fully fit again and never dizzy. I wish you all the luck in the world in finding a good diagnosis and then a cure. I honestly don't believe that anxiety causes dizziness - that just doesn't stack up. Take care and don't give up eh. Lisa were you diagnosed with lab or bppv before you had brain surgery? I am just wondering if you were mis diagnosed? I had an MRI done and it came out normal. you had brain surgery? My dr did some neurological testing.. you know with the eyes, the reflexes.. blah blah.. says nothing shows to worry him yet.. til I have hearing test..  Sorry if my post was misleading in any way. I had brain surgery for hemifacial spasm (and dizziness was part of the package, but just a very small part of it). I am not suggesting that anyone else on this site needs brain surgery. But, it is a good idea to rule out anything neurological as part of the process of elimination. Dizziness is so debilitating and I really feel for you. I have a friend who has Meniere's Disease which she seems to control quite well with medication....... but, you need a proper diagnosis before you can address the problems eh. Good luck. Hi Smiles,I've had dizzy- giddy for 3 years,I suffer from tinnitus had that 8 years now, went to ENT and consultant ,got me a hearing test same day,On that outcome I was given an MRI scan all came back fine,they say I have hyperacusis tinnitus . This year I had eye test told optitician about my balance problem, she checked me out thoroughly,my eyes had not changed in 4 years no change in prescription.when I'm sat down it's not to bad,it's at its worst when walking ,looking down or up.and standing on a chair is a no go ,wait till you get a hearing test and eye test but I'm sure ENT will want done what I had done .your be fine but do tell ENT about the balance the tinnitus is an on going thing I'm afraid I do try to ignore it but with difficulty,in the early days it has been known to just go, like it came .so keep your chin up .best wishes x"

          "Hi there! New here and wanted to post to share my experience.. I have no idea if I am experiencing vertigo or what it is.... I have had dizzy episodes in the past that always went away... years ago... like 7 years ago.. maybe the odd one here and there.. starting in Dec.. I had a few days where I was turning and took some gravol it would subside.. In January I had 2 episodes of the spins... no way I was able to get up they were that bad.. no nausea.. but since that last spin.. I have ringing of the ears.. (started in right ear) I had dizzy and movement everyday!! some daytimes not bad but awful when I layed down to go to sleep.. close my eyes and dizzy movement or movement coming towards me.. not fun... then a weird thing started.. episodes of out of the blue a sudden wave of dizzy that would make me jump or gasp.. lasting 1/2 second.. and gone! I will be at work or anywhere really and i would jump when it went through.. you could almost feel it.. go from one side of the head to the other.. or into ear.. just a dizzy feeling.. I dont black out.. only a few times did I feel like I was going to fall back.. The spins and dizziness lasted over a month.. I was getting pains in left temple, headaches across forehead or over left temple.. but it's better.. now I thought I was feeling better..and the quick wave of 1/.2 second ones are still hanging in.. maybe 2-3 x a day... sometimes Im looking down at my iphone.. sometimes Im not.. I've had all bloodwork done.. all normal.. an ENT app't booked for MAY! ugh too far.. I have eye exam in a week.. to cross that off..fam dr tested me for vertigo.. (laying back fast with head turned.. right side was a little but not bad.. does vertigo actually cause these little waves too? I feel fine once they are over fast just worry.. like all we think the worst.. I just worry cause this flash of dizzy is different.. sometimes i could be looking down and reading and feel like im going to fall over.. once i look up or adjust im good.. if anyone can share similarities.. so hard not to worry.."
