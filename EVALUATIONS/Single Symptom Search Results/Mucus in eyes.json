          " WOW, I have some of those symptoms for some time now and now the dry eyes the last month which is disturbing me alot. I don't have any of the typical GERD symptoms and medication is doing nothing for me. I did stop taking B Complex but I do have a new one I purchased (sublingual) so just as a preventive measure I'm going to take it daily again. I do eat lots of veggies and fruits. I don't eat red meat maybe once bi-weekly and a very small portion so maybe is time to eat read meat once weekly and take those B Complex sublinguals. Thanks for the information. ;-) Thanks Amy for sharing this info. I wonder where do you buy subligual co-enzyme , is it over the counter and what brand is good ? Hi, this is a really helpful thread. I have been diagnosed with lpr, the doctor looked at the back of my tongue with a microscope and said that the tonsils on my tongue are damaged. Is this also a sign of deficiencies ? I've been put on lanzoprazole and it's made my tongue feel swollen and the back of my mouth feel so dry and also makes me bloAted 24/7. Not too sure if it's done much for the other symptoms as I have a cold at the mo so got a sore throat anyway. I've decided to go on a low carb, low fat and low acid diet which is making me miserable. Anyone got any help they can give me? I'm a teacher too so shouting is also really bad for my voice box if it is lpr. "

          "I was initially diagnosed with LPR for my symptoms, which were constant post nasal drip, hoarse voice, and a click when I swallowed. I have since figured out it wasn't LPR at all, and that all the protocols for LPR only make things worse. I came here to hopefully help others who may have been told they have LPR when really, they have something else. The symptoms of LPR are exactly the same as the symptoms of nutritional deficiencies of B vitamins, vitamin A, and iron. In particular, a riboflavin deficiency will dry out the soft tissues of your throat so that you feel every tiny drip of what is actually normal mucus. Riboflavin is a B vitamin that is not stored in the body and you must eat it every day. Dairy products, something many of us with mucus are told to avoid, are very high in riboflavin, and one of the best sources. Stress, illness and certain chronic conditions can increase the body's requirements for riboflavin, causing deficiency symptoms, like a dry, post nasal drip in the throat. (In my case, I became deficient due to an undescovered thyroid issue. When the thyroid is not functioning properly, you do not metabolize riboflavin.) Mild riboflavin deficiency will also cause dry, itchy or burning feeling of the eyes. Other B vitamins which affect the throat are niacin and folate. Iron deficiency causes tongue and throat swelling and can even cause webbing of the esophagus. Vitamin A and zinc also affect the mouth, tongue and throat. Iodine is essential for the salivary glands. Certain health issues can affect the metabolism of nutrients. You can be deficient even though you get plenty of it in your diet. Your genetics, your diet, and your current health conditions all affect your nutrtitional status. Proton pump inhibitors and acid reducers can make things worse by reducing your absorption of nutrients. If you want to try some vitamins to see if they will help, start with the water soluble B vitamins. I recommend taking co-enzymated sublinguals which melt under your tongue, so that you don't have to worry about whether you are digesting and metabolizing them properly."

          " Hey, that is sad that they do not take you seriously. My nurse practitioner didn't listen to me either, she tried but I do nt think she understood. I had sintitus and was given antibiotics and a steroid, I took all my meds but the steriod due to high bp and being a diabetic, but anyways I have been doing alot of reasearch about head pressure and I found out it was due to the way I was sleeping I love pillows and I slept with five and the way I was sleeping caused pressure to my neck that felt like hell. It went from my neck to my face to my head, for weeks I didn't figure it out till last week that it was the way I was sleeping from the post of this sites and others. So for the past few days I have been sleeping with two good pillows and my neck feels so much better and my head pressure is gone. Keep doing your own research keep trying to figure out what is wrong with you, cause at times doctors try there best but we known out own bodies.  Erik, I think you need to go somewhere else. Many doctors that don't see things on screen will dismiss you. I suggest researching the Internet for additional topics. Think outside the box and don't try to put all symptoms in at once. You may find something similar. I am not sure where you are located, but to find a speciality hospital versus just a regular one. You need someone on your side. Push these doctors and keep asking questions. Make sure someone is going with you to the doctors and taking notes. I think you need a very good neurologist!!  Hi, I have been suffering from the exact same thing for 15 months. Can I ask, do you feel worse when bending and leaning over? I myself initially wasn't very well and had eye pain, it was a few days later symptoms like yours started. 15 months on I'm very close to getting an operation to fix me. I have a blockage within the sphenoid sinus cavity Ostia (drainage point). I've had 3 scans in the 15 months, all deemed normal. Because of this I bought them and had a look for myself. In all 3 scans there was mucus thickening at the sphenoid Ostia. Now apparently this is deemed normal as a scan the next day would more than likely show it had cleared. When I pointed this out to my 4th ENT he was very interested. It's very unusual as odds should say that on at least one scan it would show as clear. On Thursday I will see an ENT surgeon who will talk about the next step. The operation is called ballon sinoplasty. It opens up the airways within the sphenoid cavity which I think will cure me. The internet is full of people suffering from these symptoms and nobody knows the answer. Well I think I do and if this works for me it may well work for many others. Get back to me as I would like to chat more. I have 80 people in a group with these symptoms, I believe I'm close to finding the problem."

          "Hi everyone. My name is Erik. I am a 20 year old male, thin build. 6' 2'' at 170 lbs. I have had really debilitating issues for the last 5 months. The issue is that I feel drunk, spacey, loopy, high and dizzy all the time. It basically feels the same as if you were tipsy or the high feeling you can get. I also have visual disturbances. My vision has become blurry and I have somewhat tunnel vision. I just feel all around out of it. I find myself daydream, when I say this I mean my eyes don't focus on anything (go blurry) and just look at nothing. I think it might be slight double vision. Sounds are also very werid and it takes alot of energy to focus on visual and audio stimulants. Additionally, I am tired all the time. Extremely tired. Some days I will sleep very well for 10-11 hours and still be tired when I wake up and exercise will not wake me up. It is like the type of good solid sleep you have when your body is sick.. My memory has gotten really bad as well as my ability to process thoughts and engage in conversation. Imagine being drunk all the time...first I have been reading on boards like this for a long time now and have seen some people with these symptoms but no answers!! People seem to disappear. I hope hey have solved this problem but please let me know how! Let me start by giving some background information. In August 2015 I was in an indoor rock climbing gym and fell from 15 feet straight onto my back. I could not move for a good 15 minutes because it hurt so bad. I wasn't able to do anything athletic after that day for at least a month. However, I did not have my current symptoms after this fall. Fast forward to December 15th 2015. I got really sick, was in bed for 4 days. Sore throat, eyes hurt like crazy, and super tired. It was during and after these 4 days that I developed a headache. This headache causes a pressure/dull/sharp pain behind my eyes, the upper bridge of my nose and right in between my eyes on my forehead. This headache lasted for about 4 months. At about 3 weeks into the headache I went and saw an ENT as I thought it was a sinus infection. i took multiple sets of antibiotics over the course of the next month to no avail. I got blood tests and liver test at around 2 months into the headache and nothing showed abnormal. I then was able to get into a nuerologist. They were unable to find anything after taking an MRI of my head with a barium contrast. Since the beginning of my headache I have been seeing a (PT) physical therapist mostly for my neck and back since after the fall my back is sore constantly. I had a neck injury about 5 years ago on a trampoline so I have a sore neck, tight muscles alot from that. At about 3 months into the headache (3/15/2015) I developed a new symptom, the drunk/high, dizziness, loopiness. I had the headache at the same time at this point. My PT suggested that I may have a blood vessel being pinched in my neck or a nerve being pinched in my mid back area where my rock climbing fall pain is mostly at. I have been to 3 different chiropractors since this has occured about 5 times to each one. It has not helped so far. My PT gave me massages in my affected back and neck areas. Also a new thing I've noticed recently is that when I look up (bend my neck to look at the sky) I seem to get some sort of relief? Also ever since the loopy part started (this did not happen when I just had the headache) any amount of alcohol at all will make me SUPER DRUNK, literally like 2 sips. I used to be able to drink 3 full beers before getting buzzed. I am thinking I want my doctor to give me a full head (brain/upper atlas) to lower back (tailbone) MRI so that my nerves and blood vessels going to my brain can be evaluated. Do you think this is a good idea? Has anyone had these symptoms before? I am now 5 months into this and it is debilitating. No doctor is taking me seriously because I am so young and the chances of having a serious problem are supposedly slim because of my age. PLEASE HELP!!! I feel like I'm caught in a dream and losing my awareness and my IQ. I am afraid something is damaging my brain and this is going to be permanent."

          " Hi Laura, Thanks for the post. It's great you've found something that helps you. The DownWithAcid org uk book and website has a list of many different \"natural\" remedies that others have found helpful. Hi Laura I have the symptoms of silent reflux and unluckily symptoms of chronic reflux . My doc has just upped my dose of lansoprale to 90mg . But I m still suffering on a daily basis. I m waiting for endoscopy. My ears are always painful and blocked and doc has not helped me at alll. I am always clearing my throat, and feel the mucus at back of throat all the time with the something stuck in my throat symptom too. I have also started to have the odd nose bleed. Will try the vinegar as anything that helps I appreciate. Do u know if anything relieves the constant mucus and probs with my ears?? Thanks x Thank you for your post, I will certainly try hunegar, will let you know if it works, and I will go on the site that Barretts has recommended, I too am pleased I have found this group x  Hi laura98485, I've been suffering from silent reflux for almost a year now. Been to my medical doctor and a ear nose and throat doctor. Both seem to think that I have reflux. I had a endoscopy and a Upper GI. The Edoscopy showed that I was refluxing and with a lot of inflammation. The Upper GI didn't. I only seem to have symptoms of the throat, nasal passages, ears, and eyes. Both doctors prescribed 40 mg omeprazole with what looks like a endless supply of refills. But, so far its not working. Upon instruction of my doctor I lifted my bed up off the floor. Still no relief. I also changed my diet again no relief. I just found out two days ago about the apple cider vinegar. So far I have only taken about one to one and one-half teaspoons per day. The first time I took it I had a headache. The headache went away and the burning seemed to stop for a while. So I took a little more. Still had a slight headache the next day after eating and more burning. I guess I should keep trying it? What foods do you eat? Any more advice? Is the vinegar still working?"

          "Hello fellow suffers. This post is only really for silent reflux suffers as iv never had heartburn or indigestion which seems to be the most common symptoms of typical gerd. Iv been following this discussion group since I was 1st diagnosed with lpr in may this year, although I think looking back now id been suffering for a long time. My symptoms were mainly coughing and wheezing especially after eating and much worse at night and mornings, also had breathlessness, burning throat, hoarseness, pain to shout,and phlegm like spit up all the time, was constantly at docs and always put on antibiotics, steroids, and sinus sprays, all failed to help. Eventually after months of feeling terrible and a few hospital stays for \"asthma attacks\" a gp sent me for an endoscope and put me on omeprazole. Endoscope confirmed lpr, I was to take 20mg in morning and 20mg evening of omeprazole. Had no other advice from docs, so this is when I found this group and learned about all the other things I could be doing to help such as raising bed head, eating little and often and foods that may make symptoms worse. This all helped alot although I was still struggling and still suffered with all the symptoms, but only at night after my dinner (which I had brought forward to 5pm, so I was a good 5hrs without eating before bed). My breakthrough came a couple of weeks ago, all I did was this- I still take a 20mg omeprazole tablet 1st thing (at least half hour before breakfast) then 10 minutes before eating any meal drink a table spoon of hunegar (a mix of apple cider vinegar and honey) which you can buy ready mixed from health shops mixed with half a glass of water, then take your next 20mg of omeprazole mid afternoon and NOT evening which is when most people are told to take it! This helped me enormously with my evening meal, and gave me a much better night. The apple cider vinegar and water I drink 3 times a day (before breakfast lunch and dinner). I can honestly say by doing this I feel for the 1st time in months that I have some control over this horrible depressing illness. I know this advice will not work for everyone as we are all so unique but it wouldn't do any harm in trying I suppose. I'm sorry for long post but I really want to try and help as this illness is not recognized enough in the medical field. I'm a young active mum of 2 little ones, don't drink, don't smoke, am not overweight so it just shows it can effect anyone! I would like to wish you all the best of luck to you all and thanks for all the support and advice on here xx"

          "<p>Back in December, I experienced the worst headache/migraine of my life. It was a feeling of undescribable head pressure(I describe it as fluid surrounding my head). Pressure/headache in the eyes was really terrible. When I thought I was feeling a bit better and got up to move around, the head pressure would return and I had to lay back down. This lasted 2-3 days. I thought I would recover, but I&#39;ve never felt the same since... And I&#39;m only 28. No prior health issues to this. I have a 5 year old daughter and to be honest, this is completely ruining my life. The head pressure has never gone away.</p><p></p><p>The head pressure was so bad on and off for the first 4 months I literally thought I had brain swelling(that&#39;s how it made me feel). It felt as if someone was moving my brain around. It&#39;s as if your head is fatigued from working too hard and it&#39;s in a constant state of shaking. A very weird, undescribable, uncomfortable, scary feeling. I had really bad brain fog. I would have moments where I would space out so bad I felt as if I was in a dream for the majority of those months. So detached. I still have those moments.</p><p></p><p>Everyday I wake up, I have head pressure(blood shot eyes). My ears feel the need to pop deep inside the cavity. Uncomfortable and unease feeling of my head(like it&#39;s fatigued) is the feeling that makes it the worst. My head feels clogged and I&#160;espcially feel it in the surrounding portion of my back eyes, ears and head. I don&#39;t ever feel normal. There might be a relief of head fatigue from time to time, but my head has never felt the same. The only thing that makes me feel somewhat normal is if I lay down.&#160;</p><p></p><p>In the beginning 4 months, putting on hats, listening to loud music, over the ear headphones only made my head pressure worse and give me terrible headaches for the remaning day in the begining.&#160;</p><p></p><p>Went to the ER twice the first few months for the head pressure symptoms and followed up with my primary care doctor. They all said stress but ultimately was referred to a neurologist, ENT &amp; Eye Doctor to cover my basis. I&#39;ve had an MRI of the brain with and without contrast done. Only thing that revealed was a few mucus cyst(which are normal I guess). I&#39;ve had a panel of blood work ran which all came back normal. Checked for Thyroid function, blood count and few other things. Had a CT scan done of my sinus(no prior sinus or allergy issues in my life) and pending results on that. Not really optimistic it&#39;s going to show anything.</p><p></p><p>I don&#39;t know what to do at this point. I truthfully feel hopeless.. I need help</p>"

          " Thank you for taking the time to make such a comprehensive post - hope you have happy swallowing!! Regards Tim you are more than welcome Tim Ray Thank you for sharing what happened. It has given me a good idea to what I will expect in January when I have my op. thanks Thanks Ray - your story is much appreciated by us all I am going exactly the same as you mate - had a course of botox injections 3 weeks ago and it has not helped - back to see consultant on 15 Dec 2008, I reckon I have now lost over 2 stone since September 2008 - Consultant told me that I would lose weight but is this a normal loss ??? how many pounds did everyone else lose??? Consultant told me prior to botox injections that he would probably do a diluatation if botox did not work thereaher it would have to be a operation. it looking like a operation now as hardly eating and cannot keep anything down at every meal Kaybee, Hang in there. you are going through probably the worst period. if you can push for the operation i promise it is such a difference will little or no pain. Hi Ray I hope you are still doing well. I am eleven weeks post op now (same operation). There are complications to this op. My stomach lining was perforated, which has caused a much longer recovery period and im still in a lot of stomach discomfort, needing analgesia four hourly. I was able to eat toast and a sandwich for the first time this week, my swallowing is almost back to normal. I have no other symptoms. This op has been the answer for me and I would go through it all again. Just not all are as straightforward. UPDATE I started to have feverish flu like symptoms on the 2/12/08 and was admitted into Hospital for observation as they thought i had either a perforation, a clot on the lung, or a viral infection brought on by the surgery. Luckily for me it was the last conclusion and i was treated by way of anti biotics that is slowing helping me out of the infection. I stayed in hospital until the 4/12/08. It came about when i started to have a stabbing pain under my rib cage on the right hand side when i breathed in and out so it was thought my right lung might have been infected. The pain was accompanied by a very severe flu like condition with my entire body aching. thankfully after going on I/V anti biotics the flu like condition has lessened and i am starting to feel alot better. I can still also eat well which is a big plus. Everyone please hang on in there and good luck with dealing with Achalasia. [quote:03590080e0=\\\"RayBelfast\\\"]My Life with Achalasia A little bit about me \u2013 I am a 38 year old married male with 2 young children living in a little place called Northern Ireland. I have up until now lead an active lifestyle playing Rugby for most of my adult life but now eventually hung the boots up so my fitness is going and I am putting on a bit of weight. (still not in bad shape though ha) Looking back I can only ever remember that whatever I had to eat seemed to stick in my throat but up until October 2007 I actually thought that this was normal and how everybody felt when they ate. However if I had a good drink with my meals they seemed to go down ok and I had no real problems. (Occasionally I did suffer from bad bouts of painful heartburn/indigestion but that was about it and other than that I seemed to be in general good health) Then in October 2007 my life started to change forever. I started to notice that all food/liquids were sticking after I had consumed them. So much so that I would take on the appearance of a character from a sci-fi movie in that I felt my eyes water and bulge out of my head and I would contort and move about just to get the food down and get a bit of relief. However you do have to eat so this would happen quite a few times daily. At this time I started to get recurrent and painful heart burn. I went to my local GP and explained my symptoms and I was told the heartburn may have inflamed my oesophagus casing a slight stricture hence my difficulty in swallowing. I was prescribed a course of Lansoprasol. I started the medication and my heartburn disappeared but the problem in swallowing continued, so in Late November I returned to the GP and was told to double up my dose of Lansoprasol. CONDITION UPDATE: - In December 2007 my condition got worse. I now found myself not only struggling with eating every meal but I started to wake numerous times in bed during the night with coughing fits. During the coughing I would bring up food particles into my mouth. The coughing got so bad that I had to move out of the bed I shared with my wife and into the spare room so at least she could get some sleep. In January 2008 I again returned to my GP and explained the latest conditions and I asked him if I could be referred to a specialist. Luckily for me I have private Health care so my GP gave me the name of a Consultant and a letter of introduction. I got an appointment with a Specialist in February 2008 and explained my symptoms and felt that something extremely sinister was happening in my body with visions of cancer becoming more evident. This was because I had tried to self diagnose myself on the internet typing in \u2018difficulty when swallowing\u2019 and everything seemed to indicate I had cancer. The Specialist tried to dispel any fears of cancer and he said the best route would be a series of tests starting with an endoscope examination of my esophagus. CONDITION UPDATE: - By now I found that if I coughed hard enough my mouth would fill with \u2018Gloop\u2019 \u2013 this is my self made medical term for what I can only describe as a thick sticky substance made from my own body\u2019s saliva and mucus taking the appearance of a clear gunge. On occasions I found myself in public and taking a coughing fit resulting in the gloop making an appearance - now on a good day with not to many people around I could just spit it out discretely but on a bad day when people were about I had to swallow it again. \u2018Gloop\u2019 also started to make regular visits when I was in bed trying to sleep. In March 2008 I got a date for my endoscope examination. I arrived at the clinic and was brought to a theatre room where I met with my Consultant. He explained the examination procedure and I was asked if I wanted a full general anaesthetic or a local throat anaesthetic. I choose the local so was fully awake during the procedure (an option I would still choose). The anaesthetic tasted of rotten bananas a taste I actually liked remindi Hi Lynn Sorry to hear of the problems you to have been having. It is however nice to know i am not the only one over here. Hope you get treatment soon as as it has turned me around completely. I am still having a better quality of life and it is unreal to be able to eat and no coughing at night time. i have put on about a stone in weight since mainly because i can't stop eating things. However because of my weight gain i have been getting recurrent heartburn/indegestion pain that are quite painful. i met with my consultant on the 31st December and he has give me the all clear to resume a full life so i will be getting back to the Gym that i have still been paying membership for. Please get in contact and i hope all goes well for you x Thanks for replying Ray. I am still struggling and not eating solid food at all now. The pain, coughing and vomiting is not worth it so just surviving on hot drinks of horlicks and complan. Interested to know where you live and what hospital you attended. I'm in Killinchy, Co.Down and attend the Ulster Hospital. Lyn hello again Lyn I am actually living in Bangor. I had my surgery in the Ulster Clinic as i was lucky enough to have private medical insurance. The Consultant surgeon that carried out the Operation on me is actually from the Ulster Hospital so if you are going there i am sure he will have an input into or carry out the surgery on you. In relation to the eating, i too was at a point were i couldn't eat because i would only have to bring it up again soon after eating. It is a terrible point and i know exactly how you are feeling. Hang on in there for a while longer and before long you will get out for a meal to Lisbarnett House. Ray What an experience it is. It is late now and anyone is interested please reply and I will be glad to answer. In response to what I have read in this column, here is my case. 20 years ago at age 34 my esophagus motility stopped. That is, there were no more contraction to bring the food to my stomach and therefore achalasia stepped in. 10 years later age 44 my swallowing became nightmare and I lived through every symptoms you`ve all described with achalasia. At age 45 I`ve lost within 1 month 34 lbs and diagnosed with achalasia. I meet with the world`s top surgeon for cases of achalasia and he suggested the full thoracic surgery. Having never had surgery in my life I did research on the Internet and found that achalasia can be treated with surgery by laporascopy. 5 small incisions. 3 in my case. Within a month I report to Ottawa Canada Hospital where I go through surgery with minor difficulties because of 3 botox injections I had in the last 3 years. I didn`t know that botox injections left scars. 3 years go by and it starts to re occur again and I now have a very large upper esophagus which I have to occasionnaly have to be upside down with a finger down my throat to empty the esophagus. I am now 55 years old and I`m back at the same point I was before surgery 8 years ago. I was warned 8 years ago that the chances of having esophagus cancer in the next 15 years was very high because of the reflux that would have to be controlled for the rest of my life with medication. Reflux could destroy my esophagus walls and cancer would set in. December 18 2008 in Montreal again doing the last medical tests, and 45 minutes of talking with the same worlds top surgeon I talked with 8 years ago, I decided to have it his way. A full thoracic surgery. My esophagus will be removed and my stomach will attached to my upper larynx. It`s going to happen before the end of march 2009. Waiting for the phone call. It`s a 8 hours operation. 15 days in hospital, 3 months at home to rest and eat normally like all the rest of you once again. Here is a link and pictures of how the surgery will go. [url=http://surgery.med.umich.edu/thoracic/clinical/what_we_do/esophagectomy_faq.shtml][b:cb2ba27fae]http://surgery.med.umich.edu/thoracic/clinical/what_we_do/esophagectomy_faq.shtml [/b:cb2ba27fae][/url] This surgery has been done at this medical facility in Michigan USA University Medical center on more that 2000 patients. I have no one to talk to who I know has had this surgery. 8 hours on the table..hmm very frightning.I will be very gratefull if any of you have had this surgery in the past. I will be happy to read your comments. If there is no one out there who read this.. I will glady inform other on my return from hospital once it`s over to let you all know how things have went. Hang in there everyone. You say you had 3 botox injections and you had minor complications with the surgery, do you know if that was related to having the botox. I have had 2 lots of botox and do to have the Hellors myotomy next week? I hope all goes well with you. Hi, The botox injections leave scars which make it difficult for the surgeon to perform a proper surgery. Not that it can't be done, but if you can live without botox injections before the surgery, the better it will be for you and the surgeon doing the surgery. Botox injections in my case only lasted 3 to 6 months. Each injection bought be little time. Only time will tell if a full thoracic surgery was the best for me. Hi Rlavallee, when you had your surgery 8 years ago, did they do a fundoplication to stop the reflux."

In March 2008 I got a date for my endoscope examination. I arrived at the clinic and was brought to a theatre room where I met with my Consultant. He explained the examination procedure and I was asked if I wanted a full general anaesthetic or a local throat anaesthetic. I choose the local so was fully awake during the procedure (an option I would still choose). The anaesthetic tasted of rotten bananas a taste I actually liked reminding me of a strong shot of spirits you would get on a night out. A few minutes later and my throat went numb making swallowing even worse but not in a way you can\u2019t handle. The endoscope was inserted into my throat and I felt it move down my oesophagus and into my stomach. There was actually no pain involved in the procedure just a slight uncomfortable feeling when the endoscope pushes air into the cavities so the consultant can see about. 2 minutes later it was all over and I looked at the Consultant with worry asking him did I have cancer. He told me he could see no evidence of cancer but that my oesophagus was grossly dilated with a large amount of food debris indicating I might have a problem with my lower oesophageal sphincter muscle. He said he had a good idea of what my problem was but further tests would be needed to confirm his suspicions. At this point and based on what I was told I again checked the internet and this is when I first became aware of the condition \u2018Achalasia\u2019. I got my further test date early August 2008 and this was for an oesophageal manometry and 24 hour PH level test. The entire procedure was conducted by a trained nurse who I must say was very good at explaining the procedure and again a local anaesthetic (the rotten banana one) was used this time it was sprayed into the back of my nose. (Be prepared it is as if someone just punched you on the nose). Again any pain only lasts seconds so it is not something you can\u2019t handle. The procedure involved a thin wire being fed through the nose down the oesophagus into the top of the stomach. It is done to measure the muscle strength of the oesophagus when you swallow. My results were bad showing no muscle strength at all and my lower sphincter was so tight the nurse couldn\u2019t manage to get the mamometry wire passed it. She off the record informed me it looked as if I had \u2018Achalasia\u2019 CONDITION UPDATE: - Since my endoscope procedure until the date of the manometry test my condition had got a lot worse. I could feel any food now that I ate sticking in the oesophagus queueing up and not passing into the stomach at all. As well as the \u2018gloop\u2019 appearances I now found my entire meals coming up I had lost over 20lbs in weight (all without any form of training). I was getting little or no sleep at all so was walking around like a zombie most days feeling terrible and dreading meal times. Because of the constant tiredness you become lethargic and everything seems to be a chore so depression starts to kick in and you automatically enter the why me feeling sorry for yourself mood. In mid September 2008 my Consultant received my tests results and I met with him for my official diagnosis so I now had \u2018Achalasia\u2019. The Consultant was a specialist in Laparoscopic Surgery and he told me although my condition will never be cured it can be treated to greatly improve my lifestyle by Hellers Myotomy with Fundoplication and it would be his advice to go straight to surgery. To be really honest if the consultant had said he could do the op immediately I would have got up on his office table there and then but a date for the 18th of November 2008 was made. CONDITION UPDATE: - from the last consultation up until my Operation date my condition deteriorated drastically losing now I had lost 28 Lbs in weight. I actually after every meal would go to the toilet and make myself cough dislodging any food in my oesophagus which on looking at it was a cross between Achalasia and bulimia. OPERATION: - I was admitted to the Hospital the day before my surgery where I was spoken to by the anaesthetist and he briefed me about the entire procedure. Samples of my blood were taken for testing etc and I was settled down with some medication to try and calm my nerves. I did try to sleep but must admit this was a very difficult thing to do. My Operation was scheduled for 11:00 am on the 18th so not only was I in the Hospital overnight but I had most of the morning to wait as well. This time was hard and a lot goes through the mind I guess fear of the unknown as I had no form of surgical procedure in my life up until this point. 09:00am: - I was given medication again to settle my nerves 11:00am: -Nobody has came to collect me getting worried 11:20am: -They came in through the door and started to wheel my bed out of the room. Something inside me actually said \u201cget of the bed and run\u201d but I couldn\u2019t move (It wouldn\u2019t have been a pretty sight anyway as my backside was hanging out of the gown they had given me to wear). I looked at the theatre staff in full theatre uniform pushing the trolley this time not through bulging eyes but eye\u2019s the size of dinner plates. I tried to make small talk as I\u2019m pushed along the corridor towards the lifts. The Staff can see my panic and try to make small talk back to me. Then out of the lift and straight into the Operating room. Once in through the door I see the anaesthetist who spoke with me the night before. He has a really calming influence and then behind him I see my Consultant who stops what he is doing and comes over with a smile. He chats about what is going to happen whilst the anaesthetist puts a line into my arm. No pain so far just nerves. The anaesthetist then starts talking and I say to him I suppose I will wake up later and the operation will be over he tells me yes I will know nothing about the operation at all. It seems surreal but I was probably chatting away for a good 10 minutes up to that point but this is all I remember. The anaesthetist then said you will start to feel a bit wosey in a second or two and I felt a really nice warm rushing feeling travelling up my arm and then my lights went out. 1:30pm: - I wake up confused in the Recovery ward and immediately feel a searing indigestion like pain. The staff immediately noticed my distress and within 10 seconds my pain has gone as they have given me pain relief. I then sleep mostly until 5:30 pm in the recovery ward until I am taken back up into my room again. 5:35pm: - I come round a bit when I am back in my own room and on waking I must admit I was not in any real pain just what I would describe as a mild discomfort. I looked at my stomach area which had 5 small and very neat stab wounds held together by a total of 12 staples. I probably smiled at this point because the operation was over and I had come out the other side without a great deal of pain. Due to the anaesthetic I drifted in and out of sleep for the remainder of that day and woke early the next. The Nursing Staff did constantly check on my progress throughout this time and I was given paracetamol and Voltorol for pain relief. I was also put on an entire food and liquid fast for a period of 24 hours. The day after Surgery: - I woke early again with discomfort not pain and was able to get out of bed and get up on my feet. I went to the bathroom and washed myself then back into bed. My Consultant and Anaesthetist both came to see me at separate times and they informed me of their findings during the operation. I was told that on endoscope examination they found a huge amount of old and decaying food around the lower muscle that was starting to adhere to my oesophagus wall. So not only was my lower muscle tight and nearly closed but the food was causing an obstruction as well. They removed the food and cleaned the area. The Hellers Myotomy and fundoplication went exactly as the Consultant planned and overall they were extremely pleased with how it all went. At 1:30pm that day I was allowed lunch (30ml of water) and I drank it all down and couldn\u2019t believe it when I felt the cold of the water passing the lower muscle and into my stomach. On the hour up until 5:00pm I was allowed 30ml of water and then this increased to 60ml up until 9:00pm when I was allowed an unrestricted amount of liquid. I then had a full glass of water followed by several cups of tea and all flowed into the stomach without any problems. The next morning I was allowed a bowl of Rice Crispi\u2019s to eat for breakfast followed at lunch with scrambled egg and an omelette for dinner. All the food passed with only a sip of water. I cannot express this feeling of being able to eat again it is like I have been given a second chance at life. All in all I spent a total of 4 days in Hospital and have walked out the door a new man. I was even able to walk to nearby shops on my own and buy chocolates for the nursing staff and when my wife collected me we went shopping and I had a cup of coffee whilst out. Again I was in discomfort but absolutely no pain when walking about. So now the aftermath. It has only been 6 days since my operation and my Consultant has even told me to start food experimentation and I have had Toast and ham sandwiches (wow bread that I haven\u2019t had for about 5 or 6 months) but I have mostly been very good taking sloppy foods but everything so far has sailed down into my stomach. I do however think mentally that this is too good to be true and I am waiting for the old feeling to come back again but I am just thankful for what I have now and will just live for the moment. I haven\u2019t coughed at night at all and have had full sleep which is another wonderful feeling. I am not so stupid as to think that I have been cured as we all know there is no cure for achalasia but what I can say is that I have been helped to a degree that will change my life completely. I don\u2019t know how long this will last for and I am aware it can come back again but on the other hand it might well just last me a lifetime. I am also all too aware that my swallowing will never be that of a normal person but please let me tell you that at the minute it\u2019s not too far of it and being honest it is the best I have swallowed in my entire life. I cannot stress enough to anyone out there who has this condition and who is frightened, depressed, and suffering that whilst there is no cure there is excellent treatment available to help elevate the symptoms so that you can get back to a normal life. My Consultant informed me that the best treatment for me and my particular case was the Laparoscopic Surgery and I can say so far it is turning my life around completely. I can promise you if you are trying to make your mind up about this form of treatment that there is little pain involved more discomfort than anything else and it is probably less discomfort that you are feeling without being treated."

          " You need to get sorted out via a gastro enterologist. Don't take no for an answer. Sorry Maria meant to ask you if the hospital had done any tests such as a scan or colonoscopy or gastroscopy? Have u had any looseness or any blood , mucus in your stools . What colour are they? Have stool specimens been sent off for parasitology etc? Have yu had any medications that trigger off these episodes or any foodstuffs attacks? Have u been checked for gluten, wheat, soy, corn yeast cows milk dairy intolerances at all are u in the UK?. IBS pain can make me feel sick if I get a bad flare up. I have never heard of any one fainting because of it. However. everyone's IBS and pain response is different. Sometimes, IBS pain can feel like period pain which can make people faint. In the past period cramps have made me feel as if I was going to pass out although I have never done so. If a cold towel stops the fainting, I would continue doing this. I use Buscopan and Ibruprofen if the pain is bad and it works for me. You could also go back to your doctor and ask for strong pain medication. I think this so called 'IBS' needs investigating thoroughly (again) :| Have you ever tried having the depo contraceptive injection. Mine was that bad but since having that my symptoms have decreased to manageable pain. A lot of ibs in women can be hormonal related.  You definite need a profesional in GI track to consult. A second opinion is needed urgently. Do not wait till it becomes worse. Also sort out your diet. Ask for colofac which helps with IBS. Good luck"

          " Hi my son has a similar problems with his eyelids,was on and off..believe it was an exzema type condition.he only gets it now and then now.Id sudgest a dermatologist.  Blepharitis can be a real problem and until you find the right treatment for yourself it may persist for a while. You say you have dandruff so for a start try using an anti dandruff shampoo,they are often connected and Lee's advice to see a dermatologist is a good one. It can be a sign that the meibomian glands in your eyelids are either infected or are slowly drying up,causing dry eyes. This is what I have. You dont say your age but I'm guessing you may be young as you mention pregnancy and your daughters future. Dont wear any eye makeup until this is clear. Dont wear contact lenses. Make sure you use hydrating drops for your eyes at all times during the day...dont let your eyes start to feel dry. I use a lubricating eye ointment at night..its thicker than the day time drops and can last quite a while. In UK we are often told to use Johnsons baby shampoo in a very dilute solution for blepharitis. Dip a cotton bud in the solution and work over the eyelid edge but dont scrub, that can make them sore. That should loosen any crusts and the night ointment should keep them softened and should gradually clear up. One type of dry eye can be inherited Thygersons Keratitis. Does anyone in your family have dry eyes as well as you? I inherited this from my Mum's side but my Mum was OK. It was her sister that suffered. In UK refractive [laser] surgery is not undertaken for sufferers of this condition because the cornea can become thinner with little lubrication. It takes a long time to get this condition back to normal and takes perseverance. Dont rub your eyes,dont touch your eyes unless you have washed your hands first,and only use the Johnsons shampoo on or near your eyes. Keep all makeup away from your eyes especially anything in powder form and glitter [glow] type. Just try to keep your face clean and moisturised but nothing else,except maybe lipstick. This can be associated with acne Rosacea,but you need a diagnosis first. Do you have skin prone to spots? If yes and you find they are persistent and difficult to clear you may need a 6 month dose of a special antibiotic.....thats where a dermatologist could help. Dont despair...it sound complicated but as I have said each case is different and you need to find the routine thats right for you. Oh dear I feel for you. It can be so debilitating."

          "I feel really down and I hope someone can kindly answer me. Even having moderate myopia, but before starting blepharitis, I lived in a nice life with all day make up and contact lenses, use iPad, iPhone and drinking much coffee as I want. But, this year, I rarely wear them. First, I only have eye strain. I visited doctor. I don't know why I have eyelid inflamed. I visited doctor 2imes already (once a week). I used his eyedrops for 2weeks(opticorn n maxitrol). It just better and never clear up. So, I stop use them now. He never mentioned what kind of blepharitis do I have, he said my eye balls are ok. He don't even tell me about self care. My blepharitis started 5weeks now. I do hot compress and lid scrab 1-2times/days. I sometimes, use coconut oil, I often can see blood vessels surrounding my iris edge as well as on sclera, some mucus also come out from my eyes few times per day. I feel unwell like gritting and dry as well as after wake up. I difficult dealing with it, So these few days I feel little better by using New V.Rohto eyedrops. Now even my skin seem not well. I'm having dandurff, dry skin, itch skin often, even my face is also itch and often have red poins appear, but sometimes, it gone. I drink Royal-D in the morning and omega 3 before bedtime. I really sick of this cos Don know when will it clear up. How long will it get under control and how long I can back to contact lense again. I feel really down now since I gain lot of weight and skin lines cos of my pregnancy, having moderate myopia that not yet stable, n high IOP (20, 19). now I cannot use any make up and contact lense even on party, I want to do reflective surgery in the future. But, I search through online and can see that blepharitis is complicated and can cause a lot of eyes problems such as dry eyes, abnormal blood vessels growth in the corneal, corneal ulcer, conjuntiva problems and else. I want to let my life go cos of this very often, but I can't cos I need to find a job some months later for my daughters' future. Now I feel I dying alive. How sad. :'("

          " <p>Oh dear having a hole in your lung sounds awful and I hope you feel a lot better soon.&#160; As to your prognosis much depends on what level the emphysema is at ie what your lung function is (FEV1).&#160; If you are diagnosed in the early stages there is much you can do to help prevent further damage to your lungs such as stopping smoking (the most important one),&#160; eating healthily and exercising regularly.&#160; Medication also helps.&#160;</p><p></p><p>If in the later stages all the above will still help but your life will be affected more.&#160; Emphysema and copd is a progressive illness but it is by no means a death sentence.&#160; Even sufferers at the later stages can still have a reasonable quality of life and live for many years so don&#39;t despair.&#160;</p><p></p><p>I was diagnosed mild 9 years ago and am still mild!&#160; Most people die with copd/emphysema rather than from it these days.&#160; x</p><p>&#160;</p> <p>HI Jeannie</p><p></p><p>So sorry for your situation.&#160; It won&#39;t be possible to live a regular life if you mean as you were before the lung issue,&#160; but you will be able to live a reasonable life if you look after yourself.&#160; Ask your doc for referral to Pulmonary Rehabilitation for education on how to manage the symptoms and find out what helps and what hinders.&#160; Basically a good diet, stay away from any smokey environment, exercise regularly whatever you can manage.&#160; The working environment could be dodgy and usually damaged lungs are more susceptible to infection that means you should try and avoid anyone who may be infected with a cold or the flu virus, just as best we can, its not always achievable, but we can try.</p><p></p><p>Avoiding further lung infection is very important and learning to recognised when you have one (something you learn at PR) and to act quickly on treating it.&#160;&#160;</p><p></p><p>Have annual flu shots and a pneumonia vaccine, again speak with your doc (it will be covered on a PR course.</p><p></p><p>Wishing you a good recovery.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For those with very mild COPD or lung damage it is possible to achieve much more and continue working, its only when lung damage is moderate or severe things become more difficult.</p> All of the advise here is excellent and valued/true!, however at your age I would ask they test you for alpha one antitrypsin deficency, If you live in USA this is easy contact the Alpha One Foundation, if not let me know I can advise you...its a genetic disease and it causes people to have chronic emphysema usually in the fourth decade of life, sometimes it presents younger, but your in the bracket to be ruled out on this..its a serious disease but it has to be ruled out so your able to get the help you need and advise ...I was diagnosed aged 46. I had severe emphysema out of nowhere and a lifetime of good health, it was a big shock but its managable like everyone here is saying, so please ask on this and for the test. Update us ..  The best very best thing anyone can do is stop smoking, so good for you! keep us updated and yes do check on the test .. <p>Hi Jennie,Poor you.Are you from UK? I am worried for my Disabled Husband who is 70 soon.He had to give up smoking 4 months ago,&amp; the Gp thinks he&#39;s got COPD or Asthma or Lung cancer. This Thursday 16th we will have the results. He&#39;s not able to cough,&amp; he&#39;s got no mucus on his lungs,as we have had a regular physiotherapist check him.Hes on 3 inhalers per day. Also his right ankle is swollen.Anyway he&#39;s also got chronic on going Osteoarthritis of hips knees and spine and deaf &amp; severely sighted in both eyes. And now with this it&#39;s a hugebody blow.I am making him excerise on his Zimmer frame as much as possible. I am his carer. But have the social services coming into sort things out as I need to step his care up.What do you do for work? Anyway,Hope your on the mend.Have you given up smoking? Regards Amanda </p> Sorry to hear you have emphysema, i was told last year that i have emphysema also after a routine ct scan, and i also started smoking at 12 / 13 and now 56 but stopped 11 months ago. I think you can live a good life from what advice i have had but just need to look after your self like some of the other said on here."

          " Could be sinus. Sinus pain is horrendous. First time I had it I was convinced I had a brain tumour as it made me feel so dizzy as well as the headache. worth getting the dentist to check your teeth too. I tend to clamp my jaw very tightly, not just when I'm asleep, I'll suddenly realise I'm doing it and that can cause head pain as well as pain in my jaw. These are the same symptoms that I had for many years before it was diagnosed. For me it turned out to be TMJ (or TMJD), temporomadibular joint disorder. My bite in incorrect, and I clench my teeth (unknowingly) at night. That's why some of my pain was worse in the morning. This may or may not be your problem, but it sure sounds like it. See a dentist, esp. someone who specializes in TMJ. They can make a splint for you to wear at night (or during the day). Mine worked after two weeks of using it. The pain went away completely. I still get problems now and then, but it is very important you look into this. If it is TMJ, the stress you put on your teeth loosens them, allowing decay to enter, causing cavities along the gumline. To test is this could be your problem, put your fingers on your temples, clench your teeth, and see if any of your pain is reproduced. Even if it isn't, that still dosen't mean it isn't TMJ. Good luck. My jaw doesn't really hurt its more behind my eye and the top teeth are aching. I go to the dentist every 6 months and he always asks me to bite together would my teeth not go together? To me it sounds like a Cluster Headache I suffer with these and I have been on citalopram for over a year. I have recently stopped taking my citalopram and since then I have had a constant cluster headache, after a while the citalopram should start to help prevent the headache. Did you ever find an answer? <p>Are you still dealing with this pain? If you are having this pain, see a neurologist. I have trigeminal neuralgia, atypical neuralgia &amp; occipital neuralgia.. the way you describe your pain, it reminds me of how I would describe it prior to being diagnosed.. just how frequently you say the pain is around and how long it goes for without much relief, just sounds so similar to what I have.. I&#39;ve had these diseases since I was 16, I am 27 now, before my diagnoses, my doctor thought I had a bad sinus infection, then they thought it was my teeth, has alot of dental work done then followed by getting my wisdom teeth removed, eyes checked, spine then my brain.. after they did a MRI &amp; MRA on my head then they realised what was wrong. It&#39;s not a life threatening disease, but it&#39;s incurable. </p>"

          "Hi, I have always suffered with headaches from a young age. I've tried beta-blockers and Amitriptyline which have worked on and off. I've now stopped taking them and gone back on citalopram for anxiety last week. The side effects can cause headache, but for the last 3 days I've had a pain/ache behind my left eye, temple and the top row of my teeth along with pains in other parts of my head on and off. I saw the GP who checked my eye and said my optic disc looked ok and didn't know what it was. I have had the eye pain before but not for so many days in a row. If I take paracetamol it lessens the pain for a few hours and then comes back. Thought it could be sinus related as I keep getting mucus stuck, but I don't have a cold. Any ideas??"

          " Hello, as an anxiety sufferer! All these things can definately happen! It's like your dying huh? But every doctor tells you your ok? I don't get it either! I am perfectly healthy as well except my vitamin d level! I'm very deficient and my doctor told me it will defiantly make you tired if you are deficient! I have had every symptom in the book and had multiple tests like you and all say it's anxiety! My started after I had my son a year ago! I also have panic attacks! It's the worst thing on earth! Best you can do is listen to your doctors not all of them could be wrong! I recently started a new medication that has good reveiws so I'm hopeful! Good luck! Almost every time I've gone to the doctor, they always tell me I have micro Rbc in my urine. Which causes them to worry. At one point I looked it up and thought I had kidney disease, cancer, or stones. Once I say all the potential diseases, my body went crazy. I got flank pain, I was extremely tired, and it burned when I would urinate. I went to the ER and of course they detected the micro blood in my urine and did blood tests and a cat scan to see my kidney function. ALL normal! They sent my urine out for a culture and they said if that was negative, then hematuria (micro blood in urine) could be normal and even hereditary. My dad and sister have the same problem too where it's even placed in their medical record that they have it. If you've seen all those specialist, then I'm sure you're okay. Went I went for a follow up my doctor said anxiety could definitely cause all the physical pain. If they say you're normal and okay, then you are. don't stress about it  I am sure they've checked, but in case not: iron deficiency and thyroidism (noth hypo and hyper) can cause some symptoms like yours. Perhaps your GP can look at those levels? Iron def is easy to treat - thyroid problems are also manageable. Wish you well dealing with anxiety - it's a bear! Hi Wlkrdude, contact me. Peter. The urine would reflect moderate to high level of dehydration (a good ten of those symptoms)and some of those symptoms could be a potential for a fatty liver, which a clean diet and fresh juices would tremendously help. Look up the liver and liver healthy diets. Anxiety causes lots of symptoms as well and i have had many of those symptoms but i do have some health ailments so i wouldnt rule out anything as only anxiety personally. It doesnt mean you have an illness but honestly a healthy diet for your liver and you seriously need to rehydrate your body. D3 comes in suppliments as well. A doctor will only find what they are testing for nd will not sit you down to discuss borderline stuff or maybes. So its good nothing is strongly standing out. Dehydration can really effect your body by the way. Anxiety can be the driving force behind all this as well but still need a clean diet and to rehydrate. I dropped almost twenty pound in 6wks after the flu last year and actually had many many if the symptoms you had noted which is interesting to me. Hi ..I have pretty much the same thing... tension headaches, jaws clenching, foamy urine, allways urinate at night ,lost inability to handle stress, fatigue, eyes strain.. And also all my urine test were good.But I have deffinetely anxiety than...any hope?Now Im on venlafaxine, help with depressions and panick attacks,but not sure if with anxiety. Have you ever had your thyroid checked? So many of the symptoms can be attributed to hypo or hyperthyroidism. I learned the hard way and went thru 2 years of hell trying to get diagnosed. My SISTER finally said I needed to get tested for Hashimotos (hypothyroidism autoimmune) Not much they can do but stabilize your thyroid numbers. BTW I requested T3 supplement to assure I was getting the proper amount of the hormone that basically manages our entire body. Check into it... my aunt (83yrs thought she was dying....she went to umpteen doctors...she has been hypothyroid for 30+ years and guess what....it was her thyroid. Had to adjust the dosage. Hope you have already had help and are on your way to recovery. BTW doctors I went to all said it was anxiety.  And...supplements such as D3, B12, Iron, Vitamin C, probiotic will help as well..My last blood test, I was low in all then started the supplements. Feel so much better. good luck Hello Wlkrdue, I have experiencied almost all of the symptoms you have stated, I continue to have the muscle issues, twitching, cramping, spasms ect . I too only lost about 5lbs however I lost body mass all over especially in my hips, thighs, butt and forearms. I\u2019ve been to 3 different \u201cSpecialist\u201d and everything comes back normal, I have had an MRI of my Brain and cervical spine, 2 EMG\u2019s and numerous labs. I just couldn\u2019t fathom that Anxiety is doing this to my body, I have been seeing a therapist and treating my Anxiety with natural remedies such as Teas, Lavender Oils, Meditation and Yoga, it has been very beneficially. I have been working out light and taking an organic plant based protein which has help in putting some weight back on. I know it\u2019s been a while since your post, I just wanted to follow up and see how things are going? I hope you have managed your Anxiety and are able to get things back in order. Hope all is well, Many Blessings.  <p>I know it&#39;s 2 years later but did you find out what was going on? I have same symptoms please help!!!</p> <p>Well Wlkrdude, I had to double check that I hadn&#39;t written your post.</p><p>We have exactly the same symptoms.</p><p>I also get a bit of tendon/joint pain.</p><p>The fatigue I manage with exercise, exercise is really a big help.</p><p>The pitting in your fingernails MIGHT be psoriasis, which can also manifest into psoriatic arthritis. The inflamation from this is probably responsible for the rest of the malidies but it would be interesting to compare notes.</p><p>I found quite a bit of relief in hot/cold therapy ([b]wim hof[/b] and saunas) and actually meditation and exercise. I cut out gluten and processed foods ( not as easy as you think) and that made a pretty big difference.</p><p>The muscle twitching might be BFS which is annoying but harmless.</p><p>I&#39;m guessing we have the same thing, I still have it, 2 years on, seems to be gradually getting worse but I&#39;m still fighting</p><p>Let me know how you are getting on</p> Hello, I am an anxiety sufferer too and i hate it! my urine is always dark seems like mine never clears up!! No pain or anything it of course just worries me and i have a ton of other things to go with, Jelly legs, headache,shakes, sore muscles,extreme tiredness, no appetite, and then some days all I can do it eat, nauseous, vomiting,stomach aches,list goes on and on! I will be praying for everyone thats going thru this horrible stuff!!"

          "I have some undiagnosed medical condition, and I think it's related to my kidneys. I've been to various PCPs, 2 nephrologists, 1 urologist, cardiologist and a rheumatologist. They all say it's anxiety. All my test come back realitively normal, except low vitamin d and slightly high blood sugar. My urinalysis always shows micro RBC, sometimes mucus, and 1 time WBC. I am a 29 y.o. male, 5'11\". Here are my symptoms: Weight loss: I've only lost 5 or 10 lbs, but have lost three inches on my waste. Zero appetite Nausea Hair growth has slowed Pitting nails Dry, scaly looking skin Mental/visual changes Teeth grinding in day Flank pain Waking every night to urinate, sometimes twice Cloudy/darker yellow urine Tremors of the hands Can't quit moving toes/feet during day Severe fatigue/lethargy. I barely get around anymore. Muscle atrophy. My calfs are like jelllo, literally. Tiny and jello. My forearms are nonexistent. My biceps and thighs are jello too. Dizziness when walking Foamy urine Sometimes foul urine Foul stools Bad leg cramps Muscle twitching is common and happens anywhere Arms jolt/shake/quiver uncontrollably after intense use, such as weed eating due to weakness. Insomnia Headache And so forth. Can anxiety really do this or are these doctors just terrible? I can see some things, but muscle wasting and almost bedridden level fatigue? And the urinary symptoms?"
