          " I was very interested to read this-in the past two years after experiencing none of the usual symptoms of the menopause, I have had to have two steroid injections for a frozen shoulder and I have had two for \"tennis elbow\", one of which did do the trick[ despite being excruciatingly painful] , the other having failed miserably. I have limited movement in my shoulders and I find the tennis elbow, sore and tiring. I had never thought of any hormonal connection, but it makes perfect sense. Thank you. Juno I'm glad it helped Juno. I admit to being slightly evangelical about spreading the word...I simply cannot believe so many GP's do not immediately put two and two together when a woman of a 'certain age' presents with sudden onset joint /tendon pain/tennis elbow/frozen shoulder. ALL of these conditions, in woman who has never experienced joint problems should be considered as being caused by hormonal changes. I genuinely thought I had some awful disease, from bone cancer, to motor neurone, to polymyalgia - because I could not believe my body could change so quickly and be so painful and debilitating. Typically, women who go to the doctor with symptoms of pain and stiffness are tested for inflammatory conditions - and who actually have 'menopausal arthritis' - will test negative, and their bloods will show a very low ESR and CPR. This does not help, as the baffled GP will tend to then assume it is nerve pain...or all in the mind, or Fibromyalgia - and give a low dose amytriptilene, instead of HRT.I believe a lot of women with Fibro actually are suffering from low estrogen. The first elderly male GP I saw was supposed to be the practice rheumatology expert...and he had never heard of this (and poo poooohed my tentative suggestion that it could be related to meno) yet the nurse practitioner two door down the hall knew all about it? Doesn't make sense to me. I feel I would have been crippled for years if I had not gone to see her. I am told that I only need to take HRT for a few years, as at some stage the body naturally recognises it has gone through menopause, and adjusts into old age. (What an expression!!) Some women have a natural decline in estrogen and are not affected. It seems to be the the women who have the sudden decline in estrogen/ovarian failure at the end of perimenopause who seem to sufffer the worst, so suddenly and with such ferocity. I also have a terrible elbow which constantly clicks and pops - so I sympathise with you there too. Good luck Lesley  Sorry - I forgot to add - if you google estrogen and joint pain, lots of information comes up. I also discovered that much younger women who have breast cancer are sometimes treated with with drugs to completely suppress estrogen. These women often complain of sudden onset joint and tendon problems and muscular adhesions soon after commencing treatment - which is so debilitating that a lot of them refuse to continue on it.  Hi I've been following this post with interest. I've had frozen shoulder 3 times in last 20 years. However I'm not a woman...I'm one of the others ! So, please don't all morph into one giant woman and tear me to pieces. I can see that there is likely to be a greater incidence of frozen shoulder in women who have gone through hormonal changes, especially where osteo arthritis might be developing, and this is borne out with the number of postings on the web from women who are over fifty. However, my experiences with FS were seemingly caused by a neck problem I've had for a long time....cervical spondylosis ( age 40 to 55). Each time, although quite painful for a few months, it eventually cleared up after about 10 months and the shoulder returned to normal., without fail. Point I'm making is that there was nothing intrinsically wrong with the shoulder itself, the symptoms were referred muscle spasms from the neck problem. I'm wondering if this could be true for all cases of FS and , if so, I don't see why they should focus on the shoulder for applied treatments. I think its best left alone and not aggravated further in any way. Thus it might heal sooner than one which is continually exercised. I know the Physios etc like to be seen to be doing something positive, but really their interference might be extending the problem. If they were to say that the FS is likely to dissipate after 3 months and disappear after 10 months, on its own, then we could make the choice of whether to interfere or not. In my opinion, a condition which everyone accepts returns to normal with no resulting signs of wear or tear, should not be tested in ways which might leave more permanent damage. Sorry to nudge in here on a valid argument on why women might be more susceptible to this condition. I just wanted to point out that the cause of FS may be more neck-based than shoulder based, and maybe treatments should be more concentrated appropriately. HI Well I'm very confused now. I thought lesley 998 was on to something as I am a 51 year old ( certainly on the change). I'm on my second frozenshoulder /adhesive capsulitis on my none dominant shoulder. I can see why the change in hormones could cause these problems, sounds very logical and something I will look into further. Then Gerry the neck throws a spanner in the works as I can relate to the neck problems having suffered on and off since 1999 with neck pain after disc removed and fused at C6, so could this be were my problems stem from?, yet another avenue to pursue. I had surery last year for frozen shoulder then within 8 weeks needed MUA as it became encapusalted. Now, just over a year on, the same shoulder is frozen again. According to the consultant this is unheard of. I know Gerry you would disagree with that.! I've also read that having too agressive physio is detrimental, infact my consultant has advised against it. I am worried about surgery I am going to have on my other shoulder at the same time as my MUA this is needed due to arthris , floating bone fragment and spur. I think I am going to end up with frozen shoulder again or encapsulitus. But I am hoping that there will be light at the end of the tunnel and after the surgery this time I will be pain free - eventually. All your comments are very interesitng and food for thought Hi Gerry - I absolutely agree with everything you've noted - and as I am no doctor or specialist - I have no more of a clue than anyone else! I posted because I was suddenly struck down by this awful painful condition, as are so many menopausal women - and yet no GP seems to recognise it as a symptom of menopause. It is not generally recognised, that sudden onset FS , or any tendon/arthritic issue in women of a certain age - with no previous neck or shoulder or musculoskeletal issues - could be caused by a sudden a reduction in estrogen which rapidly affects these tissues. Of course this condition affects both sexes equally...as you know to your painful cost. Neck, spine, shoulder problems hormonal issues....who really knows why this condition appears in both men and young women, and menopausal women. But it seems the resulting constricture and debilitating long term shoulder pain is the same, whatever the etiology. i was speaking to a lady last week about this who I met on another forum. She is 51, has breast cancer and has been on estrogen supressing drugs for six months.She has developed sudden onset severe pain and stiffness in both shoulders and also has problems with both elbow tendons. She is on the waiting list for a scan, and is terrified the cancer has spread to her bones because no one has offered any other idea why she is in so much pain. We both think the estrogen link is just too much of a coincidence and she feels much less concerned now she knows there could be a reason for this sudden condition after never having had so much as a neck twinge in her life. Although replacing hormones does help as I first posted above - I have to admit I am still in quite a lot of pain with this one bad shoulder. Thankfully I no longer have pains in other joints, or hips and elbows as I did, and perhaps was lucky that hormone replacement halted any further issues.I am sadly coming to the conclusion that of course, nothing can actually 'cure' FS if hormonal loss is indeed the cause.It seems once the damage is done, and the scar tissue has adhered we are playing the same long waiting game as everyone else. perhaps tabs....you have being dealt a double blow by being both hormonal, and already having had neck issues...I wish you the best in your journey.  Hi Lesley I agree with you as well. Where women of a certain age start to experience frozen shoulder, there must be a connection to hormonal changes and oncoming osteoarthritis and the estrogen treatments look like the best preventative options in those circumstances. If your advice was heeded perhaps there would be less incidences of FS in that demographic. So, I support your advice. However, where FS has already occurred I think it would be wise to not exclude the neck as a possible cause....the reason being that any subsequent treatments applied to the shoulder might be counter productive. The logic works like this for me....If someone who doesn't have osteoarthritis or isn't experiencing hormonal changes, but still experiences FS, then you have to look for a common cause, something that might apply to both sets of circumstances, but is not only evident in one. So, where I'm advocating a neck based source, and you are advocating a lack of estrogen source, I'd be inclined to put both together and say they don't necessarilly conflict. I've had FS 3 times and I'll vouch that each time it totally disappeared after 10 months or so, with no residual damage. There was no actual fault in the shoulder. So, like you, I get a bit concerned when I read posts that advocate any kind of surgical intervention or strenuous exercises, because I think that could be creating problems for the future. I understand the frustrations that drive people to these treatments, but I think its only right to add a word of caution. Chances are it will self resolve sooner if left alone. However, I totally agree that what you suggest might help with correcting the prime cause of why FS is so common in post menopausal cases. Sorry if I sound a bit like a medic...I'm not. I'm just very familiar with my own FS incidences. And I always knew it would be difficult to say my bit here, without crossing some lines. I think our intentions are the same but just aimed at different aspects. Gerry  Hello again all! Been doing more research into this and have found some interesting sites regarding FS in Japan, where hot flushes are so unknown that there is not even a japanese word for it, but the number one symptom of menopause is frozen shoulder...known over there as 'Fifties Shoulder.' I also found a site from a Vancouver based physio who states that the number one reason for developing frozen shoulder anywhere in the world is being...you guessed it, fifty and female! I am not allowed to post the link, but if you are interested google Mike Dixon and Electra Health. ...and Garry, again...I know you men get this condition! But this specific thread was to highlight the connection between frozen shoulder and menopausal women.  Hello Lesley998 and others suffering from or who have suffered AC. I am 55 years old and am just coming up to my one whole year without periods. I was diagnosed with AC in my right shoulder about this time last year and sent to physiotherapy alongside taking Ibuprofen 400mg. Whilst the Ibuprofen helped with the pain I was given the usual set of exercises to do (finger walk up wall and various other stretching exercises). I can now say that the original AC has now resolved, no pain and I can at last lift my arm enough to shave my armpits, reach for things without going 'Owww' and no more of that horrible pain that feels similar to whacking your funny bone and everything has to stop until you can get your breath back again. ROM is not as good as before but perfectly acceptable. Now I'm getting the same symptoms on the other shoulder. I'm so glad that one resolved before the other as I've heard of people getting \"stereo frozen shoulder\" which must be horrible. I must say that I wasn't terribly diligent with the exercises after a couple of months or I would occasionally do the stretches if it was particularly bad but I can say that the condition does seem to resolve itself which I think is important to mention. My GP was sympathetic and told me that it would resolve in time and he offered me intra-articular injections which he is experienced in giving but I declined as the results can be negligible. For those with very bad AC and where lifestyle and work is seriously compromised there is MUA (manipulation under anaesthetic) but should only be done by experienced orthopaedic surgeons and sounds awful! The YouTube video of the procedure put me off, even though it was done under GA. Another interesting treatment is pumping in sterile water and anti-inflammatory infusion into the joint to \"re-oil\" the joint and gently break the adhesions. This is done with the patient awake under local anaesthetic but is only practised by a few hospitals/consultants in the UK. Totally agree that it's menopause related, I have 3 friends who are going through or been through \"the change\" and they have all had frozen shoulder at that time too. I am not going to have HR as my doctors practice do not approve of it except in exceptional circumstances and the only other symptoms I have are hot flushes at night but there again I'm patiently waiting for this to subside and cuddle my \"Chillow\" instead!:D Hi Fusspot.... I had my HRT increased to the highest dose as along with the FS in my left shoulder, I was starting to get worse symptoms in my right shoulder, my elbows, and was starting to get problems with my hips too. I was just about at my wits end. I have to say, I feel the benefit of HRT - having estrogen back again has made a huge difference to my joints and tendons and I truly believe it has turned me back into a 50 year old instead of a 90 year old cripple.  Hi everyone, I am brand new to this forum and come out of total frustration. 5 years ago I had a terribly painful case of frozen shoulder. I had an MRI and an ultrasound which revealed a possibility I tore ever so slightly my rotator cuf. The examination was inconclusive but I got teh FS after moving a very heavy treadmill out one room down a hall and into another. i really over stressed the joint and thought I just had sore muscles. It took me 4 years to recover which included the shot in the shoulder twice and PT. I eventually gave up the PT as every time I went it set me back very painfully for at least 3 weeks. I was warned by the specialist that in most cases once having a FS you will get it some years later in the opposite shoulder. I dismissed this as ludicrous since mine was from a dumb injury. Well here I am 5 years later with a FS in my other shoulder! pooh! This one is different. Very painful yet not as excruciating as the first. I went to the Dr much earlier (last time I waited 3 months of trying to deal with the pain on my own) I did get the shot in teh shoulder but I can't tell it actually helped. I also got a two week batch of anti-inflamatory pills. They did help a bit but now that they are over I notice an increase in the burning and more pain. This one seems more inflamed. I can feel the burning all down the front of my shoulder and into my elbow. Sometimes even under the lower part of my shoulder blade. I am so frustrated because I can't ride my bike, open doors reach for things in the fridge, etc. :( I have read the discussion here and am very interested in the idea of a hormonal thing. I am 50 and have had some mild menopausal symptoms since my early 40's. But how to bring this up to my Dr? I am living in the Netherlands and Dr's here tend to get rather disgruntled when patients try to tell them what to look into or how to treat you. Hormone Replacement Therapy? How would I know that this is something I should look into/need? Anyone know if I look forward to getting FS's every 5 years for the rest of my life? Or does it just go away after the two shoulders? I am so sick of being in pain all the time especially when the first one only just got better (although I do not have the complete full range I used to have. I cannot wash my hair with two hands, style it, shave my pit blah blah. It's horrible. Any advise?"

          "Any ladies with frozen shoulder who are peri menopausal/menopausal and not on HRT should have a serious chat with a (preferably female) GP. I suffered for ages (two male GP's dismissed the idea of it being hormonal) before being diagnosed with menopausal adhesive capsulitis by a Nurse Practitioner who researched the subject for her thesis. This is also sometimes known as menopausal tendonitis/arthritis. After a month of being on conjugated estrogen (Prempak C) it is like someone has 'oiled' my shoulder. I felt like I had completely seized up and my bicep and shoulder muscle were like concrete. I am now able to do gentle exercises to free the adhesion, and can now lift my arm (impossible for months) to wash and dry my hair/shave under arms etc. Estrogen is the WD40 of the body, and without it, in some women the soft connective tissue goes hard and brittle. Not all women suffer from joint/connective tissue problems in menopause,. but interesting it is usually the ladies who were a bit smug, because they got got to 50/55 ish with no real symptoms or hot flushes - then bam, being hit like a ton of bricks with frozen shoulder. I also had stiffness and pain in the other shoulder, other large joints, elbows and fingers. Mornings were terrible, it could take up to ten minutes to actually get OUT of bed, and sleep? Forget it, being woken with shoulder pain every half an hour. HRT is not for everyone, but AC was ruining my life. Given that the prognosis for recovery can be up to seven years ...I decided the risk was worth it. i would never EVER have thought that simple 'hormones' could cause so much pain and change me from being a fairly fit 50 year old into a crippled 90 year old. Google menopausal frozen shoulder/menopausal tendonitis/arthritis and go and see your GP ladies!!"

          " First symptoms I noticed were a pale salmon pink mucus, which sometimes had tiny specks of blood in it. This came and went, and would disappear for a few weeks then return again. Small specks of blood or pinkish mucus would happen when passing a stool, but at no other time. Experienced no pain at all, and felt perfectly well and healthy. Occasionally, 1 or 2 drops of runny blood now and then. A small amount of watery discharge, which, gave a burning sensation and soreness. A sudden unexpected flood of blood occured once, and resulted in the initial GP visit. A sticking out tummy, as though pregnant, which got in the way of bending over, putting on shoes, and still stuck up, even when lying flat in bed. Post-menopausal, diagnosed aged 52, with endometrial cancer at stage 1B. Hi informed. The only symptom I had was a wind-type gripy pain, low in my stomach. I thought it was my IBS.

          " I agree entirely. I also use Vagifem and every time I leave it off to see if I really do need it, I go straight back to square one. Fortunately, my GP says I can use it indefinitely as I am not on any other HRT and well past menopause. Good luck. Hi Thanks so much for that inormation. I am also not on any other form of HRT, so when the time comes to request a repeat prescription, I will suggest this to my Dr. What irritates me is that one has to go through the gauntlet each time to make an appt. then wait forever. I used to get automatic repeat prescriptions for oral HRT, which is much more invasive. I shall be more assertive and confident next time! Thanks again. I have a repeat prescription for the vagifem and will need to take it always (hospital consultant recommendation) If I forget a while I am in unbearable discomfort so know there is a need. Hi jane92 5 years on now from my post above, I still use it and I too will need to take it always. I am also in unbearable discomfort if I stop and bladder issues start to kick in. It's just good that the gynaecologists and doctors agree!!! I think you are all relatively lucky. I have vaginal atrophy so badly that intercourse is completely impossible. Vagifem has no effect at all and indeed the last time I tried just inserting it was agony. My relationship has suffered and I just feel heartbroken all the time that I can't have proper sex. Make the most of what you've got while you have it! Oh poor Sue, that sounds awful. Is there nothing that works for you?  Oh, thank you! Sympathy helps!! No, I have tried NHS gynaecologists, private gynaecologists, psychosexual counselling, oral HRT, more HRT, vaginal HRT, both tablets (ouch!) and cream. Nothing works. It's like I have no vagina. When I think of my misspent youth I can't believe this has happened to me! I don't even know if it's common, I haven't heard of anyone else like this but who knows, it's not something we talk about. It wouldn't be so bad but my partner, though almost perfect in every other sense, has been completely unsympathetic and indeed angry. As I say, I'm heartbroken, I thought we'd be at it till I died... Hi Jane,Scriv and Sue and Guest. So the years have passed and am particularly saddened by Sue's situation. Nothing seems to have changed the attitudes of the medics. Since my last message so much has changed. My husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was operated on in early 2009. We knew the probable outcome and we have both come to terms with the situation and although we do miss that personal intimacy we are just happy to still have each other's company. However I am still cross that there are women out there like Sue who are broken hearted when they have done everything and yet no answer for such a simple problem. I think the problem lies in the fact that we are not prepared to put our heads above the parapet and scream because the problem is regarded as embarrassing!! Hi all, Scriv I am wondering how many times you use the vagifem per week? I am trying to remember twice a week but think I should really go for 3. June so sorry to hear of your husbands medical problems. So sorry to read your message, Sue. (((hugs))) It was a lady consultant urogynaecologist who actually diagnosed and helped me, she got my Dr to prescribe sylk too and my own male urogynaecologist has been a little more helpful recently.  Hi, I use Vagifem twice a week - Tues and Friday, which suits my issues. Can you ask your doctor to try 3 times to see if there's an improvement? It was suggested I use daily for a while but that gives me headaches, I use Wed and Sat as I find it easier to remember, may try 3 times for a bit though adding in Monday. I was originally written up for 3 days a week but thought it prudent to use as little as possible so wasn't getting the relief needed. Sadly it doesn't eradicate bladder issues which the consultant had hoped. In my mid fifties I feel positively geriatric:( I thought life after Hysterectomy and a TVT would be easier... 10mcg v. 25mcg Have just got a repeat prescription for Vagifem and notice that the dose is now 10mcg not the 25mcg that I have been getting on famously with for several years now. Apparently the 25mcg has been discontinued. Whereas I appreciate that a lower dose of oestrogen is a very good and safe idea, I am concerned that the lower dose will not be as effective and that the old problems will return. Any comments????"

          "It has been a great relief to discover that other women of my age are also experiencing this awful condition. I am 61 and really the only menopausal symptom that bothered me was/is vaginal dryness. I was prescribed HRT for 5 years after which it was suggested that I should discontinue that medication. The problem was that I soon discovered that appalling discomfort when attempting intercourse. I did some research and asked the Dr for Vagifem, which was prescribed. It did seem to work but as soon as that is discontinued after 2/3 months the problem reoccurs and the doctors seem reluctant to prescribe further treatment. After several months I read about Sylk, but really not very effective. After a lapse of several more months I decided to go back to the surgery and ask for another course of Vagifem. After an hour in the waiting room sitting with bronchitic patients, the Dr finally prescribed another course! My concern is that surely we should not have to undergo this constant roller coaster to get something so basic. How many more decades are women supposed to put up with this unnecessary misery? The effect on relationships can be devastating and it's about time this condition was properly addressed."

          " Hello, yes I have had exactly the same time, not burning like reflux, more like swallowing a load of tooth paste, very weird, sometimes gives me a headache , I thought it was fluoxentine meds so I stopped taking them but its still there three weeks later x Sarah  Hello, I have got exactly the same feeling for about a fortnight now. By the way, I am a man, 28 years of old .. so I believe, it has got nothing to do with the gender :)Is there any update on the symptom now please? I have not consulted any GP as yet. One thing we all have in common is a history of indigestion. Regards, Juggy <p>Hello! I know this is over a year after you posted this, however as it has been left unanswered I believe it&#39;s worth answering. The likely cause of this is Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR). Since you said you are currently not on proton pump inhibitors (PPI), but have been on them in the past, it is likely that your&#160;gastroenterologist had seen signs of LPR and prescribed these. Nearly 60% of all people with LPR do not suffer from classic signs of Acid Reflux that are commenly seen in patients with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), such as heartburn. Please check in with your doctor about this if you haven&#39;t, as LPR can lead to serious if not fatal complications. I am not a medical professional, so do go to your doctor. Cheers!</p> <p>Leslie, you have probably figured it out by now, but just so you know I&#39;m also menopausal and experiencing the same thing. Probably something to do with hormones.</p> Yes, I have a same problem that started recent about 6 weeks ago and it releases cold air minty from mouth. Cold air affects mouth, throat, ear and nose, nostrils, pharynx, larynx, tube in esophagus. Please Tell me a cure."

          "Hi all For a long time now I have been experiencing the oddest sensation and I am not sure if it is to do with acid reflux. I have a very cold, almost 'minty' sensation in my mouth all the time. it feels like the sensation you have when you breath in after cleaning your teeth, or after sucking a strong mint. My throat and roof of mouth feels cold - not irritated - just cold and tingly. I have had problems with reflux in the past and have been on proton pump inhibitors. I am not on a prescription at the moment. i have had an endoscopy and was diagnosed with acute gastritis about ten years ago. I often get heartburn and indigestion. I have mentioned this top my GP who looks at me like I am mad and says he has never heard of it. However, I am not imagining it, and wondered if this odd symptom was shared by anyone else with reflux. I am a lady of a 'certain age' ....:).....and I have read on the net that this odd sensory change could have something to do with hormonal changes at menopause. Just trying to rule everything out, so would be grateful for any input. Thanks"

          " Hi! I totally understand how you are feeling about your perioral dermatitis. I have been suffering with it for about five months now. Like you, I did everything to try to avoid taking oral antibiotics, as I know from experience that they do not do good things to my body. I also tried all types of home remedies... apple cider vinegar, yogurt masks, clay masks, and all types of all natural face washes. Some things would help but not cure the problem. However, about five days ago, out of sheer desperation and curiosity, I found some Bacitracin ointment in my drawer and decided it couldn't possibly hurt to try it. Since my face looked so horrible anyway, I just slathered some of the ointment on and went to bed. When I woke up, I thought I was hallucinating.... the rash had drastically decreased in severity. The red bumps were less red and raised, not the mention the oiliness of the ointment had kept the rash from getting so dry overnight. Needless to say, I tried it again the next night. It has been five days, and my rash is almost completely gone. I don't know if it's just a fluke or if these results will even last, but I'm hoping they do. I got online specifically to find somewhere to post this so that others could see it. I have spent so many hours researching remedies for perioral dermatitis, and i just knew I needed to give back. I don't know if the bacitracin will work for you, but if you're desperate like me, I would say give it a shot. Good luck!!!  Thank you Ladire! So happy that you have found something that works for you. I really think that it is a case of trying everything, just in case it works. Its so unbelievably frustrating to have something which effects you so much, yet no one really knows what causes it or how to treat it. Its really a case of trial and error. My main problem has been that my GP had never even heard of perioral dermatitis, and just prescribed me whatever he found on google. Very frustrating. It seems that most people get by through their own research! Unfortunately Bacitracin isn't available here in the UK. I will have to try and find something similar! However, the good news is that my PD has decreased dramatically. I'm not even sure if it was anything I'd used, as I continued moisturing and applying apple cider vinegar and it just kind of decreased over a few days. Its still quite red and dry, but I think it may just be the healing stages (there were times when it was so dry that it cracked aand bled!). There are certainly no bumps or itchiness anymore. So thats great news. I just sort of waited it out, and it seemed to go. Whatever the case, I know from having this on and off for a year that it may almost be gone, and sort of lay dormant for a couple of months, and then flare up badly again. So I'll bare your advice in mind for a future outbreak! I'm just incredibly happy for it to have gone down at all. Fingers crossed it stays like this in time for Christmas! Do you have any suspicions about why you may have gotten PD? I know some people say it may be contraceptive pills, or steroid withdrawal. Im interested to know, as it seems it can be caused by many things. I'm almost certain mine was antibiotics. I guess some people are just unlucky! Really appreciate your advice. Good luck with everything! I first started having symptoms of pd about 5-6 years ago but wasn't diagnosed for awhile. Mine started very subtly - just a few bumps here and there around my nose. It wasn't until just before my wedding that I got serious about trying to figure out what it was because it was getting worse and I didn't want to look horrid in the pictures. In my case I have been on oral steroids for 10.5 years because I have Lupus. I notice whenever I try to decrease my dosage I have a PD flare up. I'm pretty consistently at 10 mg/day but even 7.5 mg will cause the condition to worsen. My dermatologist prescribed a steroid cream and antibiotic combo which worked wonders as long as I was using it. The second I stopped it just EXPLODED all over my face. That outbreak lasted almost 3 weeks and I was miserable and humiliated. It's been over a year and it hasn't been that bad again. Now I'm pregnant - not sure if that's a factor - but I'm having trouble again and this time it's not clearing up. As far as topical treatments I haven't found one thing that has made a difference long term. It seems like everything works at first and then within 2 days I'm back to square one. Or if the older bumps have smoothed out there are new ones taking their place. One thing I know without a doubt is fluoride toothpaste and ANYTHING that foams (contains the ingredient SLS) will cause me an immediate outbreak. I have been using Xyliwhite toothpaste for almost a year - honestly I don't recommend it because I don't have that fresh, clean feeling after I brush. Before that I was only using baking soda and water, which also lacked the minty fresh feel, but each time I went to the dentist she would say, \"I don't know what you're doing but keep it up! Your teeth look amazing.\" But if I go to my parents and use their toothpaste I will have new bumps pop up within an hour. This is my current line of thought: Antibiotics and steroids both cause an increase of yeast in the system. I also have a serious issue with sweets and carbs - which is also a symptom of yeast issues as well as contributes to the problem. I have started attacking the PD with anti-yeast treatments. I've been dousing it with a solution of grapefruit seed extract and water at least 2x daily - 2 drops in about a teaspoon or so of water. (You can also ingest this when diluted, but it tastes like dish soap!!) I do try to swish the extra around my mouth and spit it out, though. I have also been using an over the counter anti-fungal cream. It helps with the dryness/flakiness but I'm not seeing a whole lot of difference as far as new bumps are concerned. I would LOVE to break my carb addiction to see if decreasing the amount of sugar in my system can help the problem. But that's a lifetime issue I'm dealing with slowly. I have been overeating with my pregnancy, so, again, the carbs/yeast may be a factor. Best of luck to you! I know how frustrating this is. I've never had issues with my skin and have always been told what a wonderful complexion I have. So I am just devastated over this. I don't wear a lot of make up or fuss with my face much, so this is all very aggravating.  Hi Dawn8319! Thank you so much for such an extensive reply. I'm so glad there are other people to talk to who are going through the same things as I have. After extensive research and hours at my computer screen, talking to people who have also had perioral dermatitis, I honestly believe that it is caused by different things for different people. There are definitely certain things which seem to trigger it in many people, as well as certain remedies which work for some people. But the treatment is just as ambiguous as the cause-they vary wildly from person to person. I would say though, that it does happen from the inside. I think topical remedies can keep it at bay, or alleviate the symptoms, but not completely get rid of it and often it will just flare up once you stop these topicals (as you have unfortunately experienced!). That being said, I am so dissapointed with the way that my condition has been treated by doctors. I know that it is hard to determine how to treat it, but my experience, in the UK, was that many doctors hadnt even heard of it let alone diagnosed it! It is SO common, so why isn't it more widely recognised? Even doctors who did recognise it tried to consistently prescribe steroids to treat it, even though I explained that they made it worse. Its a case of trying things from your own research I think. For me, having tried eliminating many things to try and treat it (toothpastes, wheat, dairy, fermented foods etc) there didn't seem to be any pattern or correlation. Sometimes I would eat badly and the PD would be very mild, and other times I would stick to a strick healthy regime with no 'trigger' foods and it would flare up. At the moment it is the best it has ever been. In fact, it is almost gone! No bumps, just very mild flaking in the creases of the nose which are barley visible. It is still very red though, but I think that may just be hyperpigmentation from the flakes and bumps which sometimes bled. The only pattern for me, which might have suggested a trigger for PD, was that it would always be worse around my period. I have read in many places that it may be linked to hormones. That would explain why you have gotten it during pregnancy! I suppose we won't know, but I do believe there is a link between the two. For us unfortunate ones who suffer with PD, I believe the only options are to either wait for it to eventually disappear, and, if not, to try and curb it with products we have found to work for us, individually. I don't know about you, but I got to a point where I was exhausted with researching miracle 'cures' or triggers for PD and I just sort of accepted that I will never quite know what causes it and will just have to wait it out. And less stress can only be a good thing right? I think stress really shows on your skin, too. I wish you the best of luck with everything, and really hope you find something that works for you! Congratulations on your pregnancy also......heres hoping the PD dies down when your hormones settle after your little one is born! Good luck. I have written this response three times and it keeps getting deleted! Someone in the world doesn't want me to reply to your post... Anyway, I totally agree with the concept that there may be different causes for different people. The fact that different solutions seem to work for different people says a lot. I've tried everything I've read and nothing has worked long term for me. Just when I *think* I've found an answer the PD comes back. (For the record I tried the bacitracin ointment the poster above suggested. It seems to help the redness and flaking but I constantly have new pustules forming each day.) One thing I am convinced of, however, is the theory that this is somehow related to candida/yeast overgrowth. Everyone seems to develop the condition after some sort of course of antibiotics. And I've long suspected I had a systemic yeast problem. The thing that concerns me is I've read blogs and personal accounts of people who are VERY strict about their carb/sugar intake and candida treatments and still battle the PD on some level. I'm assuming this is now a lifelong issue we'll have to deal with in some capacity. Best of luck to you as well!  Oh no! Well, glad it posted in the end! And I completely agree about the candida thing. In fact I'm pretty sure of it. It has never ever happened to me before, but happened as soon as I finished a course of antibiotics which would definitely suggest candida. Some people get thrush, but it would seem that some of us unfortunately get something chronic on our face! I have done a lot of research on the link between PD and candida, and the science is very black and white. Anti biotics are anti- life...they kill the natural gut flora, causing an overproduction of yeast. And yeast infections can surface in many places on the body. One way they manifest is through skin conditions, and something like dermatitis is exactly the thing that yeast causes. That being said, I'm not sure that anti candida diets really work at starving the yeast and healing the gut from candida. I tried the diet, strictly, for about three months and saw no difference. I've also read on many forums that many have not had success with it in relation to their PD. But I do think it is helpful to avoid the main yeast feeding foods, in the hope that eventually, over years, your flora will be replaced. I was thinking about taking probiotics. Have you had any experience with that? Through all my research, one thing that I am fascinated with is how different people's bodies react in hugely different ways to anti biotics. I have only had three or four short courses (two weeks) of anti biotics in my entire life, and have unfortunately ended up with PD for almost a year. Yet my boyfriend, who had a condition in his early teenage years which required extensive courses of anti biotics has never had any skin problems or yeast related problems (it would seem). Sometimes it seems very unfair! I am pleased that I didn't take more anti biotics, as suggested many times by my GP, to cure PD which was caused by them in the first place. If I had, I would dread to think what my PD would be like now! I think my body seems very sensitive to them. If you have to take them, it might be worth trying probiotics alongside the medication you are taking in a bid to help the 'healing' process? What do you think? Again, thank you so much for your extensive response. It has been comforting to hear other people's experiences and I am positive that PD dissapears over time. Its just a case of being persistent and trying to make it as comfortable as possible. Oh! And I forgot to mention. Two things which I think helped me a lot was a) using anti fungal soap everyday. In the UK, I got a sulphur soap from Amazon which was only about \u00a34. I know you can get zinc soaps worldwide and they seem to help a lot of people. Might be worth a try! It can be very drying, but I think that drying seems to help PD anyway, as long as you moisturise with something natural afterwards. and b) Putting manuka honey on the affected areas for half an hour or so everyday, sometimes longer. It is antibacterial and keeps the area moisturised without being greasy. It also seemed to dramatically reduce the PD in general. Good luck! Am equally frustrated and puzzled at Wow. Am sitting here a little stunned at the correlation between antibiotics and PD since I've been wracking my brain trying to figure out why I developed this. I was given antibiotics after a dog bite a few months ago but I've been on antibiotics before and never had an issue. Anyway....I've done tons of research on this and it seems to be happening increasingly often in women as of late who have never had an issue with acne before. Try using Violet Extract.... lots of success stories so I ordered some. Fingers crossed and good luck  What you have there is me suddenly getting the antibiotic angle in all of this at 6:30 in the morning...forgot to delete. I am 47 and have been battling Perioral Dermatitis for 4 months. I have started the peri menapause and had been trying various forms of HRT. Middle of August 2013 I decided to treat Menopausal symptoms with Black Cohosh as HRT was not helping. September I had my first outbreak -just a little bit on one side of my chin and one side of my mouth spots/inflamed skin and blister type spots. I tried to get rid of it myself putting steroid cream on it continually (Bad idea I now know!) It got worse and worse (experience has now shown me that in my case steroid cream inflames it when PD first comes up, yet seemingly soothes and calms it in latter stages) I went to GP and he said it was cold sores (which I had never had before) and prescribed me Anti Viral tablets which seemed to work but as said this outbreak was relatively mild. A month later it flared up again and this time a little worse and again GP gave me Anti Viral tablets and it calmed down but took much longer and all this while I was using steroid cream still, not knowing any better. A month later almost to the day the same time as my period is due, it flared up again and this time the GP said these cold sores were persistent and I had to have a long course of Anti Viral Tablets to break the cycle. It sort of helped and I carried on with tablets but it was taking a month or more to get rid of it; and while I was dealing with the last 5 or more spots another flare up would occur regardless of the Anti Viral tablets. I went to another GP and by this time I was fairly convinced I had PD and he agreed with me and took facial swabs and sent me on my way with Dalacin topical lotion (Antibiotic). This seemed to help a little but the spots kept coming and I felt like the creature from the black lagoon. When the results of the swabs came back it was neg for virus and Infection and I was told by GP to use nothing at all and stop Dalacin as it clearly wasn't P.D. Whatever I use seems to help a little but it still has a cycle of behaviour: flare up, increasing in awfulness with new spots everyday (what ever I do) then slowly starts to heal and when I get to the last few spots; which takes about a month, I then get hit by new and worse flare up. So 17th January it flares again, each time a larger area of my face is affected. See regular GP who says this time it is definitely P.D. I came away with a month of Lymecycline which I am now taking once a day. I have been told it will take 2 weeks to have significant effect. My GP does not think hormones play a part but I do as each flare up is a month almost to the day apart. I don't think the black cohosh causes it but the fact my hormones are all over the place is a factor. Some sites I have read seem to think progesterone is a factor- Lord only knows! I have stopped all steroid creams now fully as I read this makes P.D worse. My GP says PD is a grey area for GP's and from what I read PD has different causes Infection, viral, fungal or allergy. This explains perhaps what will work for one does not work for another. I have stopped all steroid creams and I wonder if hormones have caused a fungal type PD? I have been referred to a Dermatologist but this will take time for an appointment to come through. I had to beg (and I mean beg) my GP for some Eldel cream as I had read online it might help. I think GP's are irritated by my online quest for help but where it has gone on for a while and GP has got wrong diagnosis I now lack faith in them. Things I have tried which help a little: Washing face in ketoconazole shampoo (some dandruff types) to help kill candida. (Available over the counter in UK) Clotrimazole cream such as canasten as my face also itches and burns. (Available over the counter in UK) Letting face dry out washing but not using any cream or moisturiser at all. The theory being that yeast needs moist to thrive. (Pretty uncomfortable though) Lymecycline which I am currently using will post again when 2 months is up. Things I intend to try: which others have recommended: Elidel cream, Calendula Cream, (available over the counter in UK) Nixoderm, (I bought mine of Ebay, very cheap) Neem soap, (I bought mine of EBay, very cheap) Lemon juice from half of Lemon mixed with teaspoon of Bicarbonate of soda. Apply paste to face, rinse off just before bed. So I am keeping on with antibiotics. This really does affect one psychologically. I don\u2019t want to leave the house! I never had acne as a teenager. I will keep posting! "

          "Hi Everyone. I am at my wits end with my skin and wondered if anyone could suggest anything. About eight months ago I went on a course of antibiotics for a wound that wouldn't heal. It did the trick, but a couple of days after I finished the course I began to get huge flakes of skin coming off each side of my nose and just under it. There was no real redness at first, just extremely flaky skin, which Ive never had before. This then turned red on one side and was quite sore. This cleared up, but switched to the OTHER side of my nose and this is what I have had ever since. It has come and gone in various degrees of severity, but generally, it is red and mildly flaky/dry with lots of little bumps which look like acne but never come to a head. Having said that, I have been getting cystic type acne right in the fold of the nose recently. TREATMENT: I initially googled the problem and concluded it was perorial dermatitis. I didn't want steroids as I know that makes it worse, so I went to the doctor (who didn't know what it was and had to GOOGLE perioral derm!?)who gave me DUAC cream. That helped a bit but it just came back. I have since been to numerous doctors who have given me everything which I have eventually tried. I was advised to use an anti fungal cream,so used canesten (without steroid in it). This gave me some kind of allergic reaction and i got eczema all around the area where I used it. To treat this separate condition -ergh) i was prescribed a steroid cream, daktacort, which made the eczema go away but then the PD came back worse and now I'm back to square one. I'm almost positive its a classic case of PD, and since I tried everything the only option is antibiotics. However, I am EXTREMELY reluctant to take any seeing as it would seem that anti biotics gave me it in the first place! It all started as soon as I finished a course of them, having never had it in my life before. I have no idea what to do, and would appreciate ANY advice. Apologies for the huge post! Note: I should also add that I have tried lots of home remedies like coconut oil, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar which have helped mildly but not gotten rid of it. In the past three months I've also cut out wheat, sugar, dairy and yeast (considering it may be candida overgrowth). I even switched to fluoride free toothpaste. Nothing has gotten rid of it! (except the steroid/anti-fungal, and only temporarily!)"

          " Hi Neene, I am sorry to hear that you have been experiencing abdo pains again since your hysterectomy. I might not be much help here as I was looking for info about people who have taken the HRT patches and can give me a more informed choice of whether to take these or not. I had a total hysterectomy a year ago today and have absolutely nothing left at the tender age of 36, my heart goes out to you at 26. Anyway I wasn't given anything to start with as I wanted my body to settle down itself without anymore drugs. My gyne doc said I could only take a combined HRT due to the potential of the endo coming back, which is why I am surprised your suffering with pains etc when your already on it. I have been taking Clonidine, which is a non hormonal drug (GP prescribed) to help with the headaches and symptoms of menopause, this has helped a great deal, however this is where it gets tricky for me. 3 different docs have recommended 3 different treatment plans, don't take HRT, do take HRT, and its my decision to make, very helpful I hear you say!!! I have now asked to be referred to see a hormone expert who can advise me as its their speciality, perhaps it might be a good idea if you see one too. I really do empathise with you, its absolutely rotton and nobody understands. Good Luck. Hi, I was diagnosed with endemetriosis and polycystic ovaries when I was 21. After several ops I had a hysterectomy when I was 26, that was nearly 12yrs ago. I was put on climavil 1mg for a few years but I was still getting hot sweats etc so i was put on ellestte 2mg which have helped. I have had severe pains in my legs since I was 15 which has baffled doctors, I have been told that they think its linked to the endemetriosis, I still get the pains even now which I dont understand why. I too still get pains in my stomach but have been told by my GP that its impossible to get endemetriosis after a total hysterectomy however I have read otherwise. My GP gave me Amptryptiline (cant spell it) 10mg which I take at night to stop the leg pains which do work at night, I cant take in the day as it makes me . I have given up on trying to find out why Im in pain as I get told different things."

          " hi Not that I ever came across anything like that in any of the info I've read so far I am in early menopause and have just developed LPR - not sure if it's just a coincidence? Hi Ladies, I realize I'm a little late in responding to the connection between hormones and acid reflux, GERD, heartburn, etc. YES! YES! YES! I have been postmenopausal for 13 years. I never had any type of stomach problems before other than heartburn when I was pregnant with my son. During perimenopause, I developed a horrible bout of all of the above. Acid would sometimes come up in my mouth when I was sleeping (ICK!), had hearburn after eating ANYTHING, developed the sensation of a lump in my throat, had an extreme amount of thick mucus in my throat which was also sore all the time, and finally when on to develop a horrible cough. I thought I was surely dying. I had 2 endoscopies during this time. The first showed absolutely NOTHING. The second supposedly showed a small hiatal hernia, reflux, and the doc even dilated my esophagus during the procedure. I was placed on several stomach meds and a muscle relaxer. My symptoms worsened with these meds. After nearly 14 months of these symptoms and a host of others unrelated to stomach issues, I started having horrible night sweats. I had a partial hysterectomy years before this keeping my ovaries, and was 44 when these symptoms developed. I was sent to a different doc over the 14 months of for each symptom I had. Finally, when I developed night sweats, my GP ran a full hormone panel. My estrogen level was 0...non detectable. I was placed on a bioidentical transdermal estrogen patch and after tweaking the dose a few times and to my great surprise, ALL of my symptoms went away including the acid reflux and all the symptoms associated with it. In my case, it was the lack of estrogen and the dominance of progesterone still in my body that caused the relaxation of the sphincter. However, I have gotten my estrogen levels a little too high before and experienced heartburn from that, too. So, it is very important that you get your hormone levels checked and INSIST that your doctor hear you! Perimenopause and menopause symptoms are about SO much more than hot flashes and night sweats. I feel so badly for those of you who are experiencing this. I was convinced that I had throat and/or stomach cancer. It was a very scary time in my life. It also caused me to develop an esophageal spasm that bought me an ambulance right to the ER because I was certain I was having a heart attack. "

          " Hi I know what it's like. Had it 3 times in last 15 years. The first 2 months are usually the worst...I had to sleep in an armchair for weeks, propped with pillows...couldn't lie down or my arm got progressively more painful. It usually eases down in third month and lasts 10 to 12 months. If I were you, I'd think hard before any surgery, because it is usually the result of a trapped nerve , in the neck area, and I don't think they can rectify that. Try not to raise your arm above shoulder height and be careful with turning your neck to look behind or useing your arm behind you and it might just ease off quicker. Good Luck. [Hi everyone... In a way its nice to know there are fellow sufferers out there as you can understand the pain of what I am suffering... I first started with aces and pains in january and was referred to a physio from my doc... There she was great but the pain i was suffering was un bearable... I hated bedtime as i knew i was in for a very long uncomfortable night... Now I have been told i only have 20% movement and finally I am having the adhesive capsulitis injection... I have been told what to expect but if i can get some movement and less pain then im all for it.... xxx Push for what ever treatment you can get, i have also invested in a Vulkan shoulder strap... so far i have had a better night sleep... This high quality neoprene shoulder strap helps reduce shoulder pain, reduce swelling and accelerate healing. Hi there I'm another frozen shoulder sufferer joining the club, wondered what it was until I read an article in the Daily Mail yesterday. The pain I experience runs all the way down my right leg as well, is this usual, all the other pain I read about is the same. I haven't been to the doctor, am just suffering in semi silence, the odd conplaint here and there. Any tips gratefully received Hi Annie, Ive been suffering for a few months, taking anti-inflamatories and paracetamol, but no relief. My GP refused to refer me for physio and the movement of my arm deteriorated. Finally, plucked up courage to visit my local hospital who were wonderful! They made a referral to their busy physio dept, and I waited 4-5 weeks for a consultation. It was recommended that I have cortizone to relieve the pain. Wow, within 4-5 days the pain subsided. Can't believe the relief, no more walking the floor or exercising in the middle of the night to bring relief, and have reduced the quantity of tablets. Definitely recommend the cortizone, from someone who was very reluctant. Ive now started physio, which is extremely painful, and there has been a suggestion that I may need surgery - but lets see how much movement can be achieved before the decision. Good luck to everyone - this is very debilating condition. Hi. I have been suffering from frozen shoulder for 6 months now and am totally fed up with it, especially as 2 weeks ago I had the steroid injection and it hasn't worked..so don't necessarily pin your hopes on it!My physio has tried acupuncture but hat had no effect either. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going woth the pain and lack of sleep. HI, I've had frozen shoulder three times over the years. I know how painfull it can be, so I sympathise. The best way I found to deal with it, without any injections, was to find a sleeping position, whether that be in an armchair or on a sofa, with pillows, that allows some comfort for sleeping. Once you find a position that doesn't hurt, you might find that gradually it starts to ease off. Takes time, though. Maybe the healing doesn't begin until there is pain free sleep, even if it's uncomfortable. I found it bearable after the first 2 months , although the pain lingers for up to 10 months. I don't believe that the injections work for everyone...so sometimes we must take extra steps to manage it. It will disappear eventually. Try not to raise your arm above shoulder height or reach behind yourself, like you might do as a car driver, and it might help. A little experimenting with where you sleep, although unsettling at first, might help also. A couple of nurofen with some food 1 hour before sleeping might help with the worst of it. Good luck. Hey all, I can so sympathize with the pain your feeling. This is absolutely ridiculous! I started feeling some discomfort in June 2013, thought it might be arthritis, so I bought some aspirin and aspercreme thinking I would be fine ....nope [8)] July I went to see a doctor where I was misdiagnosed took some pills they offered which did not work and August when the pain became unbearable and movement became much less I went to see an orthopedic who informed me that I have adhesive capsulitis aka frozen shoulder. My first reaction was ok how do I get some relief and then that is when the bomb was dropped there is none WHATTTT!!! I was informed that this excruciating pain could last up to 3 yrs I thought that's impossible for someone to endure such pain for so long with no relief. The first sign of discomfort is the freezing stage, the point where you can not take the pain at all is the frozen stage and when you begin to feel some relief is the thawing stage. All stages hurt. I came here looking for some method of relief to find out it can return and also go to the other arm I'm praying this does not happen to me. I'm not able to work and this is very troubling for me. What does seem to bring a little comfort is heat I use a heating pad at night and a heat pack that I place in the microwave during the day it does little help but I take what I can get. Pain mostly hurrrts in shoulder, shoulder blade, middle arm, elbow, wrist and collar bone. signed , so in pain :'-(  Hi so relieved to find this forum - was beginning to think I was being a real wimp about the pain. Though I have had pain in the shoulder for 19 months its just been the last 4 months that it has become unbearable - I also have some nerves trapped in the neck. My doctor gave me a cortisone injection and I Am having physio which really hurts and not sure whether this is doing me any good. Just read about kinesio tape and thought I would give that a try has anybody had a go with this? Hi, I've just found this forum too. I've been in immense pain the past two weeks, it came out of nowhere and hit me, wham! I cannot dress or undress without assistance, the searing pain nearly knocks me out and if someone brushes by my arm, I could cry with the pain. I feel so miserable, reading about how I could be like this for 2 years or more. My GP has prescribed Naproxen. I am already taking Codeine, Paracetamol, Gabapentin and Amitriptyline for my bad back and it worries me to feel so much pain despite all my meds. I have begged my GP for Cortisone injections and he has added me to his waiting list. I'd give myself one if I could get my hands on it. I am desperate and struggling to keep going at work. I don't want to take sick leave - I can't afford to be off sick for months but I doubt I will last another week without some relief. I've read it can be helped by HRT in menopausal women. Has anyone had relief with that? Also, what about Hydrodilatation?  I'm sorry to hear that you have to go on a waiting list for the cortisone injection I had to wait a while because of some liver tests but as soon as I received those my Doctor gave me the injection - I was at the begging Stage by then. I cannot take anything stronger than paracetamol. I have bought a tens machine from boots which was about \u00a335 and this helps. I also use an ice pack several times a day plus my husband massages The shoulder morning and night. I have never heard of hydro dilation so will be interested to read any comments on this. I just don't know whether to keep going with the physiotherapist.  Just wondering how all of you who have posted comments are doing. I am trying the exercises the physio recommended but can only do a few -so painful. Tried the swimming pool the other day I have always been a keen swimmer but just can't believe how my left arm just keeps floating downwards!  So glad to have found this discussion thread. I recently was diagnosed with adhesive capsulitis in my dominant shoulder (after putting up with increasing pain and diminishing range of movement) for about four months, although it could even be longer. I was promptly sent off to get hydro dilation which I was so optimistic about because the doctor said so many people feel a 'popping' sensation and then almost right away, relief. Sadly, that wasn't my experience, it hurt a lot and while I did feel like I gained a little in the way of motion, the pain hasn't diminished. Sometimes I wonder if I really have AC because my symptoms aren't listed anywhere ... tense 'pinched' feeling in that muscle that runs from your neck to your shoulder; occasional tingling in my forearm and/or arm; agonizing pain if I accidently jerk my arm. The other day somebody high fived me and I nearly blacked out. Often this searing pain isn't in my shoulder but in my front upper arm. Are these familiar symptoms to everyone? "

          "Hi all of you out there, Now I really understand constant pain and I really sympathise with you all. When I was first diagnosed it meant nothing to me I was going on holiday to a hot country and thought it would right itself. I cannot afford to stay off work, but am drugged up to the eye-balls but that does not cover the pain, I am not able to do anything I planned and have very sleep interupted nights. I am waiting to see a Surgeon , the Physio said that there was nothing they could do - I lost over 50% movement from the start, so the pain, the longevity of this condition combined makes it all very gloomy. So all the best to you fed-up people out there, I just hope that you can have a comfortable night and get some sleep."

It started out with feeling light headed and short of breath as soon I would lie back on my pillow try to sleep. I had to sleep straight up in bed! Then the palpitations started... really fast heart rate after just a little alcohol or sometimes out of know where , but always accompanied by reflux and stomach symptoms. I had/have. Dizziness, lights bother me , neck muscles weak and couldn&#39;t go for my long walks without feeling light headed and in outer space. I&#39;ve been to lots of doctors and done lots of reading. Found out I had a few allergies and my inner nose is irritated and infected , but mostly they trhink the symptoms are caused by.... reflux!!! What am I doing ? Well, as much as I hate to be on a PPI, I went back on my omeprazole and trying to overhaul my diet . Gave up wine for now and trying to also heal the root cause of my reflux. I have seen ENT, allergist, GI, a cardiologist and a psychologist ( I&#39;ve heard anxiety a lot ). There is definite connection between the stomach and brain and something I read called cardiogenic gastritis which involves the vagal nerve that runs between your stomach and heart and when your stomach gets irritated , the heart can follow. So I am working at it from all angles and hope that by healing the stomach I will begin to feel like my former self again sometime soon... it&#39;s been 10 months for me and it sucks. I really do know what you are going through!</p> How is your iron levels ?. I have similar problems. Diagnosed with hernia / esphogitis. I get pain in chest too like a heart attack. Really awful. I feel tired, like flu, My iron level is low but not sure why. It is possible that I have bleeding in the gut but nothing was obvious on the endoscope. I have headaches, light sensativity, irratable too, hi.i have all this symptoms. i have allergy, itchy feeling. ppi just 50% work. i use antihistamine too. rabprozale work better tham other ppi."

Until 6 months ago i woke up with palpitation, felt like having heart attack. Went to doctor and yes it got worse , now i GERD with the worse symptoms. Been having dizziness the moment i get up in bed, having this blurry vision and very sensitive to light, i get legs and arms muscle ache, tension headache,tightness of the throat, i dont really get much heartburn and stomach pain, sorethroat, clearing throat often, i also have seasonal allergy, and this weird feeling like im in the outer space lol. Im really get depressed especially when i feel worse. Anyone feel this way?"

          " <p>Yes, it is nice to have your feet/ankles come back to a normal size, so you can get footware on without a titanic struggle.</p><p></p><p>When I came off amlodipine, I was put on felodipine, which was okay for a little while, but then came back all the symptoms of amlodipine. Personally I think most of these calcium channel blokcers cause issues for people, that beta blockers don&#39;t.</p> Hi Debra, i did not see it for over 12 years. So thankful for this site. It took about a week for most of the side effects to subside after stopping the Amlodipine. I feel much better.  <p>I&#39;m thankful for this site too. I don&#39;t have very high BP and am lucky enough to have a GP who doesn&#39;t get hysterical and reach for the prescription pad if I occasionally go over 140/90. However, it is creeping up - which is normal at 73 I guess - so I know I&#39;ll probably end up on meds. That&#39;s why I lurk on these BP boards.&#160;After a couple of years of hanging out on this particular forum, at least I now know which one not to take!</p><p></p><p>I&#39;m curious to know if anyone still takes verapamil, which I believe was one of the earliest calcium-channel blockers. My mum was put on it 25 years ago for alarmingly high BP when she was in her mid-70s. She stayed on it till she died aged 89. It worked very well and she never had a day&#39;s trouble with it - except when some idiotic new doctor doubled the dose because her BP was 135/80. Her feet and ankles ballooned after only a couple of days, but went back to normal when the GP dropped the dose back again after I gave him a piece of my mind.</p><p></p><p>Since I tend to be like my mother from the point of view of general metabolism, I&#39;d be happy to try verapamil if it&#39;s still around.</p> <p>My circumstances were similar to yours, in that I was on them for approx. 5 years. Felt fine for the first year or so, so when the symptoms started gradually, I didn&#39;t connect them with the Amlodipine. I had all your symptoms and more, and complete misery. Like you, none of the doctors mentioned the meds, just kept telling me it was all due to &#39;other things&#39;. I suffered for 4 years getting worse all the time, then happened to go on holiday and forgot to take them with me as my brain felt like mush but I was too miserable to care. At the end of a fortnight, I felt totally different, couldn&#39;t believe the change. Never took them since. I&#39;d say that it took a month/6 weeks maybe, for all the side effects to disappear completely. I understand that these tablets work for some, and that&#39;s fine, but I do think that doctors should be aware of how badly they affect a lot of people and listen to their concerns, not just dismiss them saying it can&#39;t be the tablets and it&#39;s obviously &#39;other things&#39; that&#39;s causing that misery. Once recovered, I felt really angry, like I&#39;d wasted 4 years of my life on those things. Doesn&#39;t do much for your faith in the medical profession. But you do recover so hang in there.</p>"

          "<p>Hi All - Bear with me as I download here. In April 2012, I was put on Amlodipine 5mg for high B/P. &#160;During this time I was the sole caregiver for two ailing parents, trying to get kids off to college &amp; going thru Menopause. Towards the end of 2013, I developed tingling in my face, sometimes my left arm and felt very vascular in my head at times. &#160;I told my GP &amp; she always told me it was my stress level &amp; I was experiencing anxiety dealing with the care of my parents. &#160;My B/P spiked again and Irbesartan was added to the cocktail. &#160;I continued having headaches, flushing, tingling, electric shock in hands &amp; calves and blurry vision. &#160;When I googled my symptoms the same thing would come up....menopause symptoms, rosacea &amp; &quot;histamine intolerance&quot;. &#160;I finally did get diagnosed with Roacea and so I just figured it was the Ros[b]asea[/b] triggering my hormonal imbalances &amp; vice versa. &#160;Every time I brought this up to my GP, she laughed &amp; said I had no more hormones left etc. &#160;So, fast forward to March 2017 when I once again went to my GP &amp; complained about my symptoms, she told me to go home and take an Ativan &amp; then this past June after my physical &amp; me continuing to complain she sent me home with a increased dosage 10 mg of Amlodipine. &#160;From June 16th - July 6th I had horrific headaches, blurry vision, drop dead hot flashes, flushing, heart palpitations, anxiety, no energy, total dread feeling, tingling in face, hands and feet, muscle pains, rash on calves, swollen ankles and feet&#160;</p><p>weird pain in my neck, upper hi issues - &#160;I couldn&#39;t stand it - when I went back in for a B/P check my B/P had actually increased instead of decreased 152/84. &#160;When my GP saw my swollen ankles she switched me from the Amlodipine 10mg to Bystolic 5mg. When the Pharmascist went to counsel me on this new drug she told me all the horrible side effects, so when I got home I just decided to look up the side effects of Amlodipine &amp; then found this forum....OMG! I have been living with these symptoms now for almost four years and thinking it was menopause, Ros[b]asea[/b] &amp; grief/stress causing these unbearable side effects. &#160;It seriously has diminished my quality of life. &#160;I told my GP I was taking myself off of the Amlodipine as of this past Saturday. I feel less anxious/depressed, swelling has decreased, tingling in extremities less, electric shock less, rash gone but still some residual headaches and still don&#39;t feel myself. &#160;My other Dr friend said it may take 2 to 3 weeks to feel better. What have other people found while coming off this horrific drug? I need to have hope that one day I will feel myself again - I now believe this drug caused my Ros[b]asea[/b], because your skin reacts to when your body is not well - Ugh! Western medicine only treats the symptoms not the cause - I am on a mission to recover my health. Please share in your recovery from this drug -&#160;</p>"
