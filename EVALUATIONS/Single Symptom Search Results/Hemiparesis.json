          " It sounds like a neural defect caused by trauma to your brain. I do not want to say anything stupid, so I will look in to this for you. Great work getting off the drugs though. I am not a fan of olanzapine because of the side effects and I am surprised to hear you had a positive out come. I checked the NCBI internet site and it seems there is a link to head injury for Yawning and on WEBMD a link to the drugs you were taking for tiredness, though the drugs do not seem like accurate causes from your explanation, what type of injury did you suffer to your head? Here is a possibility for head trauma causing Yawning. Two cases of brain stem stroke involving the upper pons and the ponto\u2010mesencephalic junction presented with transient excessive pathological yawning, associated with gait ataxia and in one subject with upper limb and facial hemiparesis. A causal relation is hypothesised between the brain stem lesion and pathological yawning, possibly related to denervation hypersensitivity of a putative brain stem yawn centre. Excessive yawning may herald brain stem ischaemia.Keywords: yawning, brain stem stroke. It sounds complex though is probably explained with simpler words somewhere else, so you should look up the technical words on the internet. A stroke occurs when blood supply to the brain is interrupted. The way a stroke affects the brain depends on which part of the brain suffers damage, and to what degree. Sitting just above the spinal cord, the brain stem controls your breathing, heartbeat, and blood pressure. It also controls your speech, swallowing, hearing, and eye movements. Impulses sent by other parts of the brain travel through the brain stem on their way to various body parts. We\u2019re dependent on brain stem function for survival. A brain stem stroke threatens vital bodily functions, making it a life-threatening condition. In your case it would have caused one of the non life threatening disorders or damage. You could have been mistakenly diagnosed with mental disorders rather than another problem caused by this, though further tests are necessary. You do not sound mentally ill to me. Though I do not have all the information. I hope this gives you greater clarity. I will research more tomorrow. Take care, Robert."

          "  please take a long slow deep breath and read this. When I was in my 20s the exact same thing happened to me. I was under long-term severe stress and anxiety when suddenly I developed weakness, depersonalization, fuzzy vision, floaters in the eyes, ringing in my ears, numbness and tingling in my arms and legs, muscle twitching over my entire body even my eyelids in tiny things like that but also in my arms, legs, and just everywhere. I also thought I had a debilitating disease . all my testing was normal and I just could not figure out what in the world was wrong with me.I was just terrified! And back then nobody was on the Internet so I literally felt like I was the only one in the world with this! The neurologist simply told me to go take a two week vacation and relax. So I had to deal with this alone and I thought I would die. i continued with the symptoms. BUT THEN....... I finally put two and two together. . I realized how long I had been under severe stress and anxiety and how I had terrible things happen in my life. I realized that the body and mind can only take so much stress before it finally breaks down it tries to tell us through symptoms. It\u2019s like the straw that broke the camels back. Every single one of my symptoms Was related to my past and current stress. I STARTED to take matters into my own hands and first went to counseling which really helped, then I started dealing with things that were causing my anxiety and changed my way of thinking about them. I developed a way more positive attitude about life, started exercising and eating right and listening to meditations for anxiety and stress. There are some great ones on YouTube. I slowly started turning my life around and my symptoms diminished or went away entirely. When I get a little anxious today, some of them may reappear but I basically ignore them and they go away. I refuse to let them control my life. i Still get floaters in my eyes but they are harmless and I ignore them. They eventually go away. Any symptoms related to anxiety and stress is not going to hurt you. Your testing came out normal. You do not have any of those debilitating diseases and you must believe that because the more you worry the more symptoms you will have. That\u2019s because they are based on anxiety and fear! testing does not lie! What you have is overwhelming stress and anxiety same as what I had. I highly advise you to get some counseling on a regular basis. It\u2019s too difficult to go through this alone. I WANT you do know that I am now in my 50s and doing very well! So please don\u2019t worry. I had this really really bad and I was able to turn it around and so can you! \u2764\u2764\u2764 also, get on YouTube and listen to some great meditations for anxiety, panic, etc. I do this every night before sleep. There\u2019s a great one for panic if you search for one called stop panic attacks now. Then scroll down to one called don\u2019t panic. She guide you through it and it really works! You can do this anywhere without anyone even knowing.   Jan!!! i great and inspirational reply... its brilliant to see how someone with similar symptoms/feelings turns out ok and is able to relate everything back to anxiety, because at the time that you feel like these symptoms are happening its very hard to believe they arent related to something physical. for me, im borderline... i go through days of thinking i have something serious, that the doctors have missed, that the symptoms they are dismissing must have some underlying cause to days where i feel like i can see how my thoughts govern me. its a struggle but realising what anxiety can do you is part of the battle. many times, in counselling, they will describe how physical symptoms are brought on by anxiety... such as fight or flight, causing panic, sweats, tension, aching etc... and this is good information but it often neglects to talk about the symptoms that are harder to relate to anxiety such as the weakness described in this thread etc but... it can be related... your mind is very powerful and clever, you can convince yourself of symptoms and anxiety causes us to tune in to feelings more than others. this combination of listening closely to your body and having general anxiety, which can cause physical symptoms without you realising it is what leads to an overall overwhelming daily struggle and helplessness. my advice is, and i give this to myself, is to take a break from yourself. treat your anxiety like its a seperate part of you and you are telling it to leave you alone so you can have a rest! i find this helps me a little. then when you are ready, try to distinguish between the subtle feelings that make you worried and some of the other physical that anxiety is causing... like the tension, stress, etc... for these latter ones, chill out, get a massage, take a bath, go for a walk, get some exercise, plan an activity, get some extra sleep and hopefully the balance will fall back into place. during bad times of health anxiety i get twitching all different places, i use to get a really bad eye twitch from anxiety then convinced myself i had a brain tumor! i also get really tense shoulders and neck, i also grind my teeth which makes things worse im constantly worrying about my health with anything i feel in my body and most of my awful symptoms are due to anxiety, it really is an awful thing to experience hi sgarrido 93. you and I seem to share a boat! I have lived my whole life completely unhindered, and then suddenly one day got an awful infection that spread from my sinuses into my lungs and then eventually out into all my joints and my heart sack, which was very nasty. From that point on everything went downhill. the infection actually cleared up very well, but sadly I did not. I had my first ever panic attack in fear of having a brain tumor (or something similar) this was before my infection was properly diagnosed. since then my anxiety has taken over my body, I have had increasing discomfort and perceived weakness down the right hand side of my body, especially in my wrist, shoulder, knee and ankle. this has recently spread to my right rib, and when I breathe now it feels like it is laboured on the right side of my chest. (I also feel a little bit of a weird bubble under my lower rib cage when I lie down, which scares me particularly), and my breathing is constantly shallow and difficult. I had begun with fears of a brain tumor, but had a CT, all clear, and headaches went away... soon after I discovered a weird morphological line down my head, and discovered scleroderma, got many many autoimmune blood panels done, confirmed I was fine, then all the symptoms went away. then I read about MS, freaked out a lot, and my hands and feet started tingling, my vision went completely mad, I had severe photophobia to the point where daylight was unbearable etc etc, went to the doctor and she basically said she wouldn't even begin the process of testing for MS because she was so sure I didn't have it, symptoms went away. at the moment im concerned about another disease, and sure enough my symptoms fit the bill. I guess my point is that everything ive been concerned about has manifested itself in some way, and whenever my brain has moved from one illness to another, my body has too. i am not the best for advice, seeing as I am not better, but I am sure this is anxiety. as you all know, it can take days to convince ourselves that what were experiencing is anxiety, and only minutes to convince ourselves that its not. what I can say is, google is the worst tool to use for self diagnosis. Google contains lists of worst case scenarios, and its algorithm is such that if you are on there googling ms all the time, when you search for something else, ms based results will show up with priority. so when you google symptoms, MS is bound to appear because google thinks thats what you want to see. the reality is, that doctors know much more than google, we can sit on google and research webmd and whatever for hours, and still not know even a microfraction of what a doctor knows. They have things they look for and tests they do during appointments that you aren't even aware they are doing. anxiety can do anything to your body. your body and your mind are totally one and the same, until recently people thought this was mumbo jumbo, but its science. your mind can do anything to your body, even when it makes no sense at all. I remember when all this began someone asking me if I had weakness down one side of my body, and I GENUINELY didnt, but as soon as I was asked, my leg got weird, and then because I have been totally focused on it it hasn't gone since. i hope this gets better for all of us, the reality of anxiety is that the symptoms are not curable, but the condition is, and doctors are aware of that. practice mindfulness, practice cbt, do some breathing exercises and minor exercise, and I promise I will too. we are fortunate in that we CAN get better, and we can defo do it together thanks to forums full of nice people like this one!"

          " <p>I would say not. My daughter has been on it for 5 years, and has never said anything about that side effect. My friend was on it for 20 years, then went right into menopause. She didn&#39;t have any problem either. Did you have anxiety before the shot. That&#39;s the question, and that will answer your question.</p> Hello I am sorry but, I know nothing about depoprovera injections. I cannot help you on this one. Jackie hello chest pain, sudden cough, wheezing, rapid breathing, coughing up blood; pain, swelling, warmth, or redness in one or both legs; fever;etc are common side effects This medication may rarely cause serious (sometimes fatal) problems from blood clots (such as deep vein thrombosis, heart attack, pulmonary embolism, stroke). Get medical help right away if you have: shortness of breath/rapid breathing, chest/jaw/left arm pain, unusual sweating, confusion, sudden dizziness/fainting, pain/swelling/warmth in the groin/calf, sudden/severe headaches, slurred speech, weakness on one side of the body, sudden vision changes. Remember that your doctor has prescribed this medication because he or she has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.. be safe <p>I had taken unfortunately Depo-Provera Depo-Provera the shots for 5 years straight for stopping severe bleeding and it was the biggest mistake of my life I had rapid heartbeat pulsations that felt like you were standing behind a giant speaker woofer and you can feel Sensations in your body in your arms pulsation your heart beating and pounding in your skin and it was so bad where I could not lie flat in a bed I live in a couch sitting up completely for 17 years now it&#39;s the worst drug that anybody could ever give a child let alone any adult either and I would severely caution anybody who wants to take this drug specifically by shot just take normal birth control pills I do not recommend this drug yes you can get severe heart pulsations and they do not go away they are permanent and the longer you take this crap drug the longer the effects are to your body and I&#39;m 31 years old and I feel like I&#39;m a six-year-old woman and I&#39;m on disability now because of that it ruined my life</p> I am 30 years old and recently got the shot once in november. I have had rapid fast heart rates and palpations something i never had before. I only got the shot once and never again it has tramatized me "

          " <p>Dear Samantha</p><p></p><p>in my opinion, and it is not a professional one, your symptoms are not of a brain tumour.

Daily Telegraph page 2 but Although I took a shot of the page, I could not paste it here.. The research was specific to men it seems but I thought it might interest you.

Radiotherapy and chemotherapy have followed. Six months later I do not regard myself as very sick although the future is far from certain.

They are usually different from headaches you might have had previously and will be persistent and worsen with time Nausea and vomiting With a headache this can indicate increased pressure in the head (raised intracranial pressure). Seizures A seizure is abnormal electrical impulses in the brain, causing sudden involuntary changes in movement or function, sensation, awareness, or behaviour. A first time seizure in an adult is often investigated. Weakness, loss of sensation or numbness This is a sign of pressure on (or damage to) a specific part of the brain and can also be manifested through walking unsteadily or lack of coordination (ataxia) or muscle weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis). Hearing loss Could be a sign of an acoustic neuroma if it occurs only on one side. Loss/disturbance of vision, including double vision In one or both eyes could be a symptom, if there is a tumour pressing on the optic nerve or there is one affecting the visual pathways or if there is raised intracranial pressure. Speech difficulties May also include the loss of ability to write, speak or understand words. A person may have difficulty getting the right words out (expressive dysphasia) or difficulty articulating them (dysarthia). Other brain tumour symptoms Lack of concentration, confusion, memory loss, disorientation, drowsiness, change in behaviour. "

          "<p>I am a 20 yo female and since May of 2015 I have been experiencing very strange and disturbing symptoms that at this point I am convinced I am going to&#160;die&#160;within the year and go back and forth with these thoughts. It is important to note that&#160;&#160;have serious anxiety, have had it all my life but after atraumatic event&#160;i felt a slight sense of derealization or brain fog back in May. I immediately attributed this to a brain tumor and went to my GP and received a neurological exam,&#160;eye exams, and blood tests which came back as normal, attributed this to GAD. An MRI was not recommended and of course I was terrified of that so I have never had one. I had a serious neck injury several years ago that never truly healed and simultaneously was experiencing neck pain again so I started seeing a chiropractor and it was determined my C1 and C2 and lower spine as well were severely and moderately subluxated. Within 4 hours after the first adjustment, I felt a strange sensation in my inner cheek that I would describe as fullness, not necessarily numb. I continued going 2x a week all summer and eventually this same feel spread throughout the same side of my face. Not numb, more of a &quot;pulling&quot; &quot;pressurized sensation. Concurrently, my anxiety has been getting much worse since and I have panic attacks fairly regularly and was recently prescribed xanax which is the only way I can stop thinking Im dying.Unfortnately, I attribute these attacks as being pre-seizures. Every day I think today will be the day of diagnosis, but I am too afraid to actually get an MRI because I&#39;d rather live in ignorance as long as possible before my life is ruined and given an expiration date. Current symptoms still allow me to live my life, I&#39;m in college, doing well, have friends, energy etc but this fear never leaves. Are my fears based in reality or can anxiety or possible nerve damage from these chiro sessions be the explanation? PLEASE someone help/ reassure/ guide me. The only hope I have is that its extremely strange all these symptoms began after I started seeing this chiro. All of these physical symptoms are worsened when I smoke weed, but it calms the thoughts down&#160;</p><p></p><p>* pressureized/ tingling on left side of face, cheek under eye. (intermittent, helped by xanax), comes and goes&#160;</p><p></p><p>*tighter muscles when closing that side&#39;s eye&#160;</p><p></p><p>*left leg will feel &quot;weird&quot; but works completely functional, have had weakness measured, not weaker than the other, i go to the gym daily and do all normal things</p><p></p><p>*occasional very inner ear blocking ?</p><p></p><p>*still have&#160;neck pain, reverse curve was shown on X-ray&#160;</p><p></p><p>*currently (recently terrified) cluster tension/ burning like head scalp pain on the right side. not necessarily a headache or&#160;migraine.&#160;</p><p></p><p>* both eyes will intermittently just feel weird, pressure behind them&#160;</p><p></p><p>* panic attacks, been obsessed with brain cancer since a girl i saw on the news died at 17 a few years ago.&#160;</p><p></p><p>*alternating head pressure on right side&#160;</p><p></p><p>*recently mind pops, memories (not flashbacks) of random events and occurences from anywhere from months to years ago.</p><p></p><p>i have a spine MRi scheduled but im terrified it will show up nothing and ill be forced to face this reality. anyone who has actually had brain cancer please offer insight&#160;</p><p></p><p>please someone help me and respond. sometimes i can convince myself that I am experiencing nerve damage/&#160;peripheral neuropathy&#160;or even psychosomatic symptoms. however it has been 7 months. i really don&#39;t want to die and every day I envision sitting in a doctors office being told I have stage 3/4 GBM or DIPG.</p>"

I remember having headaches ever since I was a kid, ever since always taking OTC meds trying to control it. Three years ago I had a CT scan that came back clear and the doctor started treating me for migraine. Ever since I took different kinds of meds but I&#39;ve never been more than 2/3 days headache free. In the last months I&#39;ve been having daily headaches, my exception is when I&#39;m not in pain. A new neurologist explained how migraine works and how he hardly thinks my case is migraine related, as my headaches are often in the same spot and they happen everyday. I&#39;m having other symptoms that I don&#39;t know if are somehow related, such as lots of heartburn, difficulty in finding some words when I&#39;m speaking, fatique and sleeppiness, rapid hearbeat sometimes even when I&#39;m resting, these are some that I can remember of - overall speaking, I don&#39;t feel well all the time, this symptoms are really having a direct impact in my everyday life, specially at work. I&#39;m kind of afraid of what this pain can be. Now I have a MRI and a QEEG Brain Mapping. I&#39;m curios to hear if any of you suffered something along these lines and if you have a diagnosis to share with me.</p><p>&#160;</p>"

He had occasional spasms, twitching, one side weakness, some food though to swallow. I have all of that! Dry food, not always, but sometimes, rare, but happened. I have health anxiety and was dealing it pretty well for a couple of months until I read this experience. I'm so scared again. PLS tell me that someone else experience this thing with anxiety.

          "<p>Hi. I apologise in advance if this is long... </p><p></p><p>Two weeks ago I started to get a tingling sensation in my mouth on the right side, didn&#39;t think much of it but the next morning woke up and the right side of my face between my upper lip and eye was tingly and numb. My face looks normal overall, my right eye doesn&#39;t blink and you can see my mouth doesn&#39;t move properly if you really look but otherwise can&#39;t tell so left it for a few hours. </p><p></p><p>I&#39;d also had a headache on that side for a few days also at the back (top of my neck/bottom of my head). </p><p>Eventually called 111 (mainly because I&#39;d previously had a DVT and pulmonary embolism - caused by being on the pill, I was 31/32 at the time - so thought might be linked) and was admitted to the stroke unit as upon testing me they found my arm and leg were also weak, which I hadn&#39;t really noticed but could tell they were when they were doing the tests. I was also getting double vision and dizziness, and feeling like the room was spinning when I would close my eyes. </p><p></p><p>Had a CT scan which showed no bleed, also had an MRI which showed a small lesion on the left frontal lobe but was told this wouldn&#39;t cause what I was having so not to worry about it. Was eventually seen by a neurologist at around 11pm on the ward and he diagnosed Bell&#39;s palsy. I asked about the arm and leg weakness and he said they didn&#39;t seem weak anymore so could have been a migraine (never had one before). I was put on 60mg steroids for 5 days, with tapering off for a further 5 days. </p><p></p><p>I still have double vision, it comes and goes but I get it several times every day, also had spots in my vision a couple of times and a feeling like there is &#39;cloudiness&#39; or blurriness, like I&#39;m looking at things through a filter on my right eye. Got new tingling in my mouth and in my bottom lip and lower jaw starting on two days after I commenced steroids, has come and gone in severity (had it all day this Weds for example) along with intermittent numbness. Have also had tingling around my groin area on the right, and expericenced some very strange sensations of feeling kind of floaty when I was lying down, also felt my abdomen was tensing. </p><p></p><p>Called hospital and was asked to go in to see the on-call doctor, he seemed sceptical of Bell&#39;s palsy as he did the movement tests again and said my arm still felt weak (leg less so but was slightly weaker than left side - this was 12 days after initial symptoms, last day of steroids). He prescribed more steroids as a precaution, 40mg for 5 days, and said to attend my gp to get an urgent outpatient referral with neurology, however I already have one booked for this coming Wednesday and so cannot get in any sooner. </p><p></p><p>One more thing that may be totally unrelated, I did have a very intense pain in my eye on the left side (opposite side to my current symptoms, but same side as the lesion) for 4 days in the week leading up to this all happening. The neurologist did ask if I had had any eye pain and I said no as was only thinking of the right side but realised the next morning I maybe should have mentioned it. </p><p></p><p>Just wanted to know really if anyone else had experienced the same and whether this is normal, as none of the doctors I have spoken to have been able to say whether it is or not? I haven&#39;t really had much actual pain, which I would have assumed I would if the body symptoms are caused by migraine? </p><p></p><p>Thanks </p>"

          " EDIT: I think I posted this in the wrong location... Sorry for that :o  I am very sorry to hear of your mother's situation. I had similar surgery performed on me, but did not have the outcome your mother has. I could be wrong, but I believe the condition she is suffering from is called *Postoperative Cerebral Vasospasm.* Google it and if it is what she has, see online which hospitals are researching or treating patients with this disease and contact the writers of the articles. Proper treatment for this condition requires very skilled physicians. Best wishes!"

          "Hello good people! I'm writing on behalf of my mother, who last September had to undergo an tough operation involving the removal of a macroadenoma of the pituitary gland. While the operation was successful, it left her with a hemiparesis on the LEFT side. She was also in a coma for about two days after the intervention. The nasty bugger was apparently massive and had done some major damage to the pituitary gland and reached the hypothalamus, although damage done there was apparently very minor. The epicrisis mentioned about 90% of the tumor having been removed. **Post-operation**: We've done several MRI scans since then, showing no residual mass in the location with no new signs of a tumor reappearing. We're constantly doing rehabilitation, so she is now able to walk (with our support, still losing balance when in open spaces) and perform various exercises with her hand! :) (still can't preform daily activities - long road ahead there!) For medication - she is prescribed Dehydrocortison (5mg tablets, 1 in the morning and 1/2 before bed) and Nootropil (1200mg, twice a day - contains Piracetam). For the first few months, she was also prescribed Citicoline, but has now stopped taking it. I'm not mentioning other minor minerals, vitamins and eating supplements, but can do if need be. **However, there are a few things worrying us as far as her current state goes, so I'd like to tell you about them here in the hope of some suggestions as to what we can do to improve those areas...** 1) **Vision**: The RIGHT (not left!) side of her face remains somewhat numb, and her right eye can barely move in all four directions. Opening and closing of the eyelid is fine. She says she feels her ride side as if being \"extruded outwards\". This leads to a weird vision resulting in difficulty of spacial awareness, especially in open spaces outside - leading to a lack of perfect balance. One night I tested her trigeminal nerve sensitivity (temple, cheek and lower edge of the mouth) - all three locations had low sensation, lowest towards the mouth. Maybe some nerves are still constricted? She was prescribed some glasses in accordance to her state, but are there any additional things we can do? We've been told to \"wait\" and that things will slowly get better... 2) **Eating is very difficuly**. She went from eating pureed foods to regular, firmer foods, but she can't really chew properly - cheek, lips and tongue on the RIGHT side are still mostly numb, so managing food with her tongue inside her mouth is tricky. She only eats on the left side, but food tends to drip sometimes and after a few bites her entire mouth goes stiff. We were recommended injections of botulinum toxin in specific parts of the right side, because she has a hyperactive muscle which apparently needs to be relaxed. We had an \"expert\" perform the manipulation three months ago - there were no improvements... Currently, we are looking to contact another specialist in Slovenia for a second attempt, this time with different injection locations. Apart from botox, is there anything else that might relax her face and allow for easier eating? Medication suggestions are welcome, or even special types of exercises. 3) **Walking** has progressed a lot, but she still has a major issue when it comes to gait and stance due to her left ankle twisting. Very often, the ankle goes stiff and slowly twists inwards, not allowing her to step with her entire foot on the ground. We were told her gastrocnemius muscle is hyperactive and constrictions are leading to this unwanted twist of the ankle. Some days stepping is fine, others it's a nightmare and her entire gait/walking is outright wrong. We noticed that shock occasions, such as a car passing by close or having to cross a street immediately twist her ankle. We are performing electric stimulations, in addition to lots of massages, stretches and exercises. She is now squatting and has proper strength in the leg, but due to this ankle problem walking is very difficult... Are there any other methods we might apply to improve this? Apart from the gastrocnemius muscle bit, it seems her brain is still heavily susceptible to stress and the commands she is getting are forcing this constriction... **Lastly,** I should mention that multiple blood tests in recent months showed increased levels of **calcium** and **B12** in her bloodstream. We have an upcoming SPECT scan of here parathyroid glands in a few days, to see if a tumour might be causing this. We were told she should drink lots of water... So, that's that. Sorry for the wall of text! I can provide additional information if needed, like more detailed breakdown of medication regimes, MRI scan reports and so on. Any suggestions are welcome - mainly for the mouth, as eating difficulties are currently the main factor for depression and whatnot... Thanks in advance! :)"
