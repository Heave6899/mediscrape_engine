          "Hi all, I decided to become a member and make a post here after reading the forums for quite a while, great site by the way. I am currently suffering with various symptoms and am in a bad way and just don't know where to turn any more so thought I would post here and see if anyone has any similar experiences or advice. So first of I am male and 26 years old. I have been suffering with the symptoms in the title pretty consistently for about 2 and a half years now. I used to have some relief from the symptoms for a day or 2 here and there or maybe a bit of relief for a few hours in the day but recently the symptoms are pretty much constant and I cannot shake them. I have an overall mild pressure feeling in the head, its not painful but is just very aggravating and feels really strange. I also have extreme brain fog with this and like a fuzzy head, there is a constant cloud over my brain and I never have any mental clarity or a clear head. My cognitive function is extremely poor now, my short term memory is non existent, its scarily bad. I often feel, detached from reality when the symptoms are bad and suffer from de-realisation, although I think this may be down to some anxiety and depression I experience when the symptoms run me down. I also get random sharp cramping pains in the head, they are quite painful but do not bother me so much as they only usually last a second or 2, it varies on how many I get of these each day but its usually less than 5. It often feels as though my brain is malfunctioning somehow and my cognitive function and senses are all out of whack, its hard to explain. There can sometimes be a build up of these symptoms throughout the day and by the night I can feel like I somehow how the flu without a fever? Like I have the head pressure, completely foggy headed, I feel super unwell, weak, sometimes even start feeling cold. Also have night sweats usually for about 4 or 5 days each month, there doesnt seem to be any sort of pattern to them that I can notice, so not sure if they are relevant. Another thing I have is ringing in ears which is mild but seems to have gotten worse recently if that sounds relevant at all. The main thing that gets me is the odd head pressure/sensation and the utterly life hindering brain fog, my brain feels like it is coated in a dark blanket constantly. I do suffer from anxiety, I know many of these symptoms can be caused or made worse by these symptoms. I dont doubt that anxiety is a contributing factor and the way I think about they symptoms probably makes them worse but I have come a long long way with my anxiety, I have good control over it, I haven't had a panic attack in a couple of years, I manage to control most of my concious anxiety and stay in a positive mindset. No doubt I still have some subconscious anxiety underlying and I am working on that but I am not convinced this is the route cause of my symptoms. I am in therapy for my anxiety. I do not feel I will ever fully recover while I have these symptoms hanging over me though. I have been to the doctor about these symptoms, although I do think I struggle to explain them or put them across very well in the doctors office. I have have blood tests which are all normal. I saw a neurologist couple of years back when this started, had a CT scan which was normal, they put the stabbing pains down to icepick headaches and thought the other symptoms were probably made worse by my anx/depression. Since then I went away and have been on anti depressants etc with no improvement of symptoms. I have also had a few ECGs and a 24hr ECG as I have slow heart rate and low bp so thought maybe the symptoms could be down to low bp and lack of blood to the brain, doctors do not think think this is the case and all my results came back normal. I have recently been back to the neurologist who is referring me for an MRI although he said he is sure there is nothing sinister and thinks the symptoms are probably tension type headaches and made worse by and previous drug use, he only put it down to the drug use when i told him about it though so it seemed like a convenient diagnosis. I forgot to mention I used to take drugs on the weekends socially, cocaine, ketamine and ecstasy on different occasions for a couple of years, I have had periods where I have felt ok since taking these drugs and do not really think they are the cause, I was not an addict this was just one or 2 nights a month at the weekends. So I have an MRI coming up but the neuro thinks it will be clear and obviously I hope it is and I am looking for other answers. What could be causing these symptoms? Other than anxiety which i no can be a factor, but I have periods where my anxiety is pretty much non existent but these symptoms still build up out of nowhere and persist. I was thinking maybe some sort of allergy could be a possibility, I have tried cutting out gluten and lactose, this didn't seem to make much difference although I didn't stick to this for very long. I actually did a juice fast for 2 weeks with eating nothing other than fruit and veg juice put through a juicer to see if that would help but it didn't really give me any relief. Are there any other stomach issues that could cause this? I never have diarrhoea or constipation, my stools always float recently though, to the point of not being able to flush them, also whenever I have seen chance medicine doctors they check me out and say they think i have issues with digestion, i don't feel i have these issues but do wonder if there might be something in it. Could there be something going on with the blood vessels in my head? Could it be a spine/posture issue? Some sort of epilepsy or electrical activity in my brain? I just have no idea now and am desperate for some relief. If anyone has any ideas or advice I would really appreciate it. Oh just to add I am reasonably fit, I try go to the gym a few times a week and I do some weight lifting. I am a normal weight. I have been losing some weight recently which is a concern but I am still in a normal weight range for height and age. Thanks for reading"

          "  It is very common to have all of this with anxiety. Anxiety effects the GI tract quite a bit and can mess it all up. It is great your doc is checking for other things as well just to rule them out. But dont stess it to bad because anxirty does cause alot of these symptoms as well. You also need to remeber that are adrenal glands are in this area as well so if you are under stress it could deffinatly erratate the GI. also 90% of seratonin is held in the GI tract so if its all out of wack it can cause seveere GI upset. from constant nausea,gas,cramps,IBS, constpation, Diahreea, vomiting and dizziness  I am sending you a link to something that I have found very interesting http://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/the-gut-brain-connection Hi Carl, I have been experiencing dizzy spells recently though not related to emptying my bowels. I seemed to be getting dizzy if i turned my head a certain way or if I got up too quickly. It really frightened me and i thought that I was going to have a stroke or something. I just wanted to reassure you that from what i have learned since it began happening to me dizziiness is rarely a serious symptom. It can be caused by so many things, the main ones being anxiety, low blood pressure and inner ear problems. My dizziness seems to have passed for now and i'm sure yours will too once you are reassured that it is a minor symptom, take care, Lisa  Hi I do get dizzy at random times throughout the day. Not just with bowel movement, and feels as though I'm going to faint but i only seem to feel nauseous and dizzy together when I need the loo. I do get a bit of tinnitus from time to time, but mostly only get the ringing ear and slight pressure feeling. I will wait to see what the blood results say before I jump to any sinister self diagnosis I have been experiencing spells of dizziness and nausea before bowel movements over the last six years. 10 to15 mins after the bowel movement the dizziness and nausea subsides. I feel very weak also during the period before bowel movements. i feel the same way whenever i take B Complex or Multibionta tablets. Thus, I don't take these again at all. I also feel lack of oxygen to my brain. I have done a host of blood work which came back negative. Hello, I've also been having a similar experience to all of yours. I originally thought it was the stomach flu/gastritis...but it's been going on now for three weeks. First off, I'm a 34 year old female with no prior serious health issues. It started out as diarrea for two days and then in the evenings I began to get extremely nauseous (no vomitting--strange). Laying down seemed to make it more intense (being in the fresh air/walking made it less intesnse). I became severely dehydrated and couldn't eat at all. So currently I'm having dizzy spells occassionally throughout the day (which seems to start or get worse during the late afternoon or evening). I also seem to have nausea/dizziness after a bowel movement. My bowels are sluggish and I'm slightly constipated currently because I had taken in very little food over the last few weeks. I feel a lot of anxiety as late afternoon comes on (as this is when it starts to get dark and also this is the time when the severe nausea started coming on three weeks ago). I've also got some minor stress in my life regarding some family members and my financial situation. I'm not sure if the anxiety contributes to the nausea or the nausea is contributing to the anxiety or both. For the past two-three days I have been improving...able to eat and getting my strength back and my stool is now solid. However I still feel dizzy occassionally and feel anxiety/slightly nauseous later in the day. My sleeping is off however. I usually sleep 8 hours a night (10:30pm-7am), occassionally wake up but have no trouble falling back to sleep but now I am falling asleep around 9-10pm and I wake at 4-6am and I am unable to fall back to sleep. I've had full bloodwork (waiting on results), x ray, urine test but nothing has shown up. I'm currently starting betahistine to rule out Vertigo. I do have low blood pressure on a regular basis, am underweight (generally), do not excercize currently and I was severely dehyrated and have eaten very little over the past three weeks...so perhaps it will take a period of time to recover from the effects of dehydration, starvation? Also, during my illness (in the first week) one of my daughters (4 years old) was up one night and vomitted several times but was fine the next day...no diarrea. My other daughter (10 months) was fussy, spit up frequently in the eveings and cried inconsolably in the evenings during this time as well. I'm wondering if I did, indeed, have gastritis...however I've never had it this severe before. I've never had a stomach bug for any longer than 12-48 hours in my life."

          "Hi All I know this probably isnt the right place but may be related to anxiety. For about 3 months I've been getting spells of dizziness and nausea. Not always before bowel movement but very often. After I have emptied my bowels the dizziness and nausea seems to subside after 10 mins or so. I was thinking IBS but I can tolorate all kinds of food. I went to my gp today for the dizziness (along with a few other symptoms) and I'm being checked out for autoimmune disease. Slightly different topic but bloods will be taken on Monday. What I want to know is, does anyone else have the dizzy/nauseous issue before bowel movement? It's very unnerving when it happens and I've had no answers so far Thanks"

          " Hi Debs your not on your own out there ,I've had this balance now for 3 years ,I get Rocking /Swaying motion ,there are exercises ,best thing you can get is a booklet on these exercises .Did you have any sinus congestion prior to the balance ,that if you did could be prime cause to any balance issues .Its hard living with it ,I can whole heartedly agree.its a bad condition to get .Hard explaining it to ones who have never had it .What I will add ,don't have ears syringed by just anyone who got no idea how to do it correctly ,You can end up with tinnitus ,same goes with a exercise called the Valsalva ,again been known to cause tinnitus .I have tinnitus hence why I say this. Hate for a soul as young as you to get this condition .There is a site for Dizzyness go and have a read up .Takecare of those ears ,only small things but they need care for you to not cause further problems .Will PM you with an address it's a free booklet if your in UK ,lot of interesting info to this balance . Hi, well am sorry to hear you have his problem too. I m same as marlene, not dizzy spinning, more swaying feeling etc. Imwould follow what Marlene say re the booklet o. Exercises, but as Imwould push your gp to refer t you to an Otologist , preferably a Neuro Otologist. (ENT,s rarely find anything. Wrong with us people!!!) They go more in Depth testing wise, so as the Ent have discharged you you are fully tilted to go back to,your gp, ask for a second opinion, but this time wit the aforementioned. Don.t get fobbed of seeing an Audiologist either. although I am not discounting them completely,mThe time wasted waiting fo the appointment, then . Seeing them, then Going back and forth and before you know it another year has gone by and you,re no further ahead.! Hi debs, I koto have had this problem which started when I was 25 and eventually fizzled out at 47 started again at 63 and lasted another 2 years. Over the years I noticed that the really bad episodes were precipitated by good streets, eg getting engaged, getting marriedn and having my first and only child, a son, Al h which happened in less than a year. Sorry to hear you feel unwell. If you feel anxious and stressed with those symptoms meditation could really help. I meditate twice a day and it's done me the world of good. You can ask your GP for Mindfulness meditation on the NHS. Some GP's may not know it's available on the NHS but it is and this was confirmed by two doctors. Meditation reduced anxiety, stress, depression and is very calming and centering. There are also free Mindfulness meditation recordings online to listen to. Hi kiddo I am 57 years old I have had the same problems as you a little more severe for going on 5 years also vertigo this summer it's a real bummer had had tests had scans had it all seen specialist still docs can't figure it out so here I am haha, basically, on my own so do physico twice a day the therapist came which I went to on my own she did wonders for me I am retraining my brain to help my balance issues also have tinnitus withahah this hearing heart beat in left ear all the time I know itIis no fun but hang in there things will get better with time still not normal but at least got Some things to do to help myself hope the new year brings you better health  Hello Ms. Deb, I am Ben, I started one of these discussions back about mid-year this year, and added to it several times. I live in the U.S.A. and my health care is paid for by my employer. I have been dealing with the light head and wavy feeling for almost a whole year now. Mine started with the room spinning and that took a couple days to subside. Then I was seeing double for about 3 weeks, along with a lot of trouble reading and had to work at reading to get to where I am now, able to read, but it is not fun anymore no matter what the subject is. I would like to comment on your situation if I may. I am not a doctor, I am someone who used to pride myself on doing things exactly right and getting to the root of problems as my solving technique. Once this dizziness hit me I have all but completely lost my ability to think critically and it is very difficult to stay on subject. So I am not able to analyze what is going on as well as I used to befor the onset. But with that said, I will do my best to help you understand what I think is going on. First, to help qualify myself, I have had so many tests and seen so many specialists that even though I am not qualified or certified to make comments, I feel that I have quite a lot of information at hand and I am willing to share with you if you are able to appreciate my efforts. Second, please bear in mind that I am having great difficulty typing and sorting thoughts to make this writing make sense and to make it possible for you to read. BUT, for me it is a form of therapy, in that I am working with the keyboard and trying to submit my thoughts and ideas to you, so it is not a oneway deal either. It helps me to try to help you. OK? Realizing that you have stated that your doctor did not find anything in your inner ear to blame the woozyness on, I will tell you that your inner ear is just about the only place that one can find cause. Although it could be water on the brain. And it could be an unbalanced vitamin, like B12, I think they would have found that if it was, so my stand is that it is exactly coming from your inner ear. The fact that you never experienced the spinning sensation tells me that you must have gotten over the \"viral\" part of the infection very quickly. Possibly you slept while it was peaking. A near miss as it might be characterized. You undoubtly had an infection, but it didn't last long and didn't do much damage to your Vestibular Nerve, but you are left with the aftermath of the encounter, as are so many of us who have the woozy feeling. You must understand the importantance of balance information that is delivered to our brains by the nerve that connects our inner ears to our brains. This information is so vital to our senses that it is responsible for our feeling of well-being. From balance to thinking, speaking to seeing, everything we do is tailored and massaged by the balance information we get from our innner ear. It was developed initallly during infancy and refined as we began to walk upright and then run and ultimately do anything we want including acrobatic moves and athletics. From tight-rope-walking to tumbling, we rely upon the information that we have been receiving from our inner ear with certainty since the beginning of life. Then along comes something that damages the nerve and it sends false information about balance and that affects everything we do, including how we think and feel. Rehab is something like recovering from a stroke in that we must retrain ourselves to use the information supplied from our inner ear, rearranged by the damage to the nerve, by doing things that \" we know to be correct\" but don't feel right about (the woozy feeling), over and over until we are able to use the information like we used to without doubt. The difference is that for a stroke victim the retraining is done in another area of the brain uneffected by the damage from the stroke. In other words, we must relearn what we learned way back in our babyhood, befor we had any adult ability to reason or put scientific sense to it, and just believe that the new information is correct. That is what I meant by doing things that we know are correct and regardless of the feeling, just believe it to be correct. Well, that's my stab it at. I hope I have helped you understand what is going on a little better, and more, what to do about it. As I stated befor, I have seen a lot of doctors and specialists and I am convinced that the exercises they have had me do are effective, but it will take a long time to evercome the sensation of dizziness and inability to think clearly or remember because of the misinformation that the damaged nerve is sending. Ms. Deb, this took me about an hour and a half to compose, so you know that I have tried to help you and I am sincere. I do hope you will understand better what is happening and what you have to do to get on with your life. If you would to know what exercises I have been doing for the last 8 months, I would be happy to share. Take care. Ben"

          "Hi there, I'm hoping / praying someone can shed some light on my extremely frustrating & somewhat debilitating symtoms. Aprox two years ago I started to feel a little light headed, I was working in retail at the time and the shop was incredibly busy (I have always worked in sales, so this did not phase me, what did cause me concern was how light headed I had been feeling) At the time, I presumed it was just a side effect from citalopram - something I had been prescribed six months earlier for feeling a little low. I did think it was strange that I felt woozy and light headed six months into the course as I had only previously experienced this feeling at the very beginning. I mentioned it to my doc and they agreed if i felt ready i should taper off citalopram - so i did. Slowly but surely i reduced my dose and presumed the light headed, dizzy almost drunk feeling would disappear - much to my surprise, i am still in the same state - blurred vision, wobbly, floaty and very very dizzy. I have been to see my GP numerous times - my iron & bloody sugar levels, thyroid have been tested. They even sent me for an MRI scan and it all came back clear. My blood pressure is a little low but nothing too alarming and the ENT doctor said they couldn't find any inner ear problems (which I kind of thought would be the case because it's not a spinning sensation that you might expect from say labyrinthitis, it's more of a constant faint feeling) It is a nightmare crossing the road or entering a busy supermarket. I am no longer quick on my feet and my memory is very poor too. I feel dazed and confused a lot of the time and extremely tired. I'm only 31 and have a real love for life - can anyone suggest what could possibly be happening to me? I would be incredibly grateful as this god awful 'whatever it is' is really taking it's toll on my work, my relationship with my partner, friends and family (more so because there is no diagnosis as yet so I feel like people don't really understand what is actually wrong with me) every day I pray that this has just been a nightmare and I will wake up and feel normal again. Look forward to your feedback..."

          " Hi, did you have a cold or anything before the ringing started? Certainly your eustachian tube would cause the symptoms you describe. Sometimes popping your ear does not give relief- most of the time it does but not always, it depends how congested it is. Also it may not be the tube causing the ringing- if you have an ear infection or fluid behind the eardrum which can cause any infection then you will have the ringing. Or before you noticed the ringing where you exposed to any loud noises?  I don't believe I was around any loud noises when I first noticed it. I listen to the odd loud song on my computer now and then, but I work in a quiet office environment and never go to concerts. This is the first time I've ever had issues with my ears. I did have a slight sore throat and stuffy noise at the time, which backs up the fact that I may have eustachian tube dysfunction. My other ear has felt a bit blocked, but hasn't been ringing like my left ear. What is worrying me the most is the fact that most of the pressure sensation has gone, and if I do feel any pressure I can usually relive it by yawning or inhaling steam, yet the ringing still persists. I have also been able to hear liquid in the ear once or twice, but I'm not sure if that is because of the steam inhalations or not as I can't hear it anymore. Ok so you can rule out the ringing noises or any hearing damage due to loud noises. You say you have sore throat and stuffy nose-your eustachian tube begins in the nose and ends at the back of the throat. It sounds to me like eustachian tube dysfunction which if they are congested due to viral infection or allergy or swollen, it would produce the symptoms you describe. It is either that or fluid behind your eardrum which can happen if the eustachian tube isnt working properly. Ringing is a symptom of this and even when ears are popped the ringing can continue if they are still congested/infected. How is your hearing overall? I would get another doctor to have a look or an ENT because if fluid stays in your ear too long it can cause an infection and pain, and you may need antibiotics. Also I would start if you havent already, a course of strong decongestants- but not Sudafed- get decongestants that contain pseudoephedrine- this is stronger than Sudafed and some others that contain only phenylephrine.  I'd say my overall hearing is pretty good, though the left ear does sound strangely distorted, kind of like it being underwater. Higher tones sound out of pitch, and lower tones seem to sound a lot lower. Shaking my head also produces some strange wobble sound in that ear too, though I don't know if that's just in my head. Could I still have fluid behind the eardrum even though I am able to equalize the pressure and I'm able to hear? Everything I've read makes it seem fluid behind the ear results in a noticeable hearing loss. The pressure does eventually build up again though, and if left will start to cause some discomfort. I've an appointment booked for Wednesday to see another doctor, at this point I will have finished my ear drops to clear up the infection I have in the ear canal. This will be the third doctor to take a look. As for decongestants, last week I was slowly going through a pack of \"Sudafed Decongestant Tablets\" which are Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, though things hadn't improved. I was told not to take these for more than a week as they'd potentially make things worse. It might actually be worth mentioning that in the past I have suffered quite a lot with hay fever, but never encountered issues with my ears. Would it be worth taking an antihistamine?  Hi, Has there been any improvement with the ringing?  None at all so far, but I've a blocked nose and sore throat again, and I can feel the fullness in the ear again too, so it could still be related to a cold or something. Saw a doctor on the 12th who said I need to wait for my infection in my ear canal to be gone completely before looking into other causes. I'm still under the impression that it is eustachian tube dysfunction, due to the fullness feeling, ringing, and muffled / distorted hearing. Also, when I swallow, the ringing ear with either make a squelch noise, or make a loud pop sound a couple of times, but I never get the popped ear relief feeling that I get in my good ear. I'm also still unable to pop the ear by holding my nose and blowing through it.  Hope you get better soon. I started off with a sore throat 2 1/2 months ago, that led to an ear infection (inflammation/redness in my ear canal) to an ETD. I've had the ringing in my left ear from the start, and all of the other symptons have gone more or less, still not quite right but better. I have the squelching sound too in both ears when i swallow/yawn and for the last 5 weeks it has been really loud. Maybe the mucus has been breaking down, hence the loudness, but who knows. It sounds like your in the early stages, hopefully it will clear up quickly for you. I've tried most things like steam baths, decongestants, steroidal a nasal sprays, etc. Nothing has really helped other than time. I know two other people who have had it for 4 months, one chap has got better though after 4 months. Their symptons have been practically the same as mine, we are from the Kent area. Maybe it's a virus, or something. I'm having an MRI scan to rule out anything else before I can see an ENT doctor. Just remember to stay positive, and stay in touch. Ryan  Are you able to recommend anything I could buy without a prescription? So far all I've tried are the Sudafed decongestant tablets, and although they clear my nose, they don't do much else. To be honest nothing really worked in the early stages, because there is nothing you can get from a pharmacy designed to work on an ETD. But it might be different for you. You just need to try different things, drinking lots of water helps thin the mucus making it easier to expel and your E tubes have the same lining as nose, it may help. Time is the only thing to have helped me. Take care. Ryan "

          "So about a week ago when going to sleep I noticed I had a constant ringing in my left ear, which I thought nothing of. It wasn't until the morning when the ringing hadn't gone that I started to worry. That was also when I noticed the fullness and slight hearing loss, so I instantly thought it was wax and tried a couple of days of ear drops to try and shift what ever was in there. A week later and I'm still experiencing the same issues. I saw a doctor yesterday who informed me I had a slight external ear infection in the ear which he gave me drops for, as well as eustachian tube dysfunction. Apparently it was the eustachian tube dysfunction that was causing the ringing and fullness. At the time that made sense, as the ear just feels like I need to pop it, and it never pops when I hold my nose and try and blow, but today I was able to pop the left ear, though nothing changed. Does popping the ear not give instant relief of ear ringing? It is really starting to worry me that I have some how caused permanent damage to my ear."

          " Hi, I have had problems finding an antidepressant that didn't give me sever side effects. I tried three different ones before finding escitalopram. I had very little side effects but I did start on only 5mg and slowly built it up. Another thing I found helped was not reading the side effects on the leaflet! Doing this only made me anxious. At one point I was too scared to even take any which is why I started on 5mg. Side effects are supposed to subside after two weeks. Apart from some excess sleepiness I have done well on them (I'm now on 20mg.) Don't dispair if you don't have any luck. It seems like sometimes you have to try different meds before you find the one that works for you just speak to your GP before making any changes to your meds. Hang in there x  Hey my name is Kim and I started this drug on February and it was bcuz Paxil stoped working for me and I have seen great results the first was was ok for me my dr also had me talk Xanax with it cause of the increase anxiety see if your dr will give you something to take the edge off while the meds get into your system I wish you the best of luck  Hey Claire, side effects are different for everyone, I really didn't have any, maybe sleep here and there, I started drinking a tea called nighty nite before bed and it seems to help. I got alittle nauseous the first 2 weeks, but not bad. I was on citalapram before and I really like this anti depressant a lot better. I've been on this drug for 2 months, and started out on 10 mg and I feel great! Hang in there!  Hi Claire. I am on escitalopram & have been for about 4.5yrs. I am 44 & suffered with bouts of anxiety & depression since I was 19. I also take propranalol 1 x 20mg tablet a day (a beta blocker) for anxiety. my escitalopram dose is 15mg now(taken in morning), but I have been on 20mg day in past. When i started this med, i didnt think i would be able to stay on it as i felt out of it, my pupils dilated & felt worse first 2-3wks. i started on 5mg 1st wk, then 10mg 2nd wk & so on until i got to max dose of 20mg which greatly helped me get used to this med, & i started to feel better after about 4wks. i was eventually (after a year) able to reduce to 15mg day which maintains \"me as me\" meaning my real personality & mental state without depression & anxiety. the side effects wore off after 4wks of starting. as i have had many bouts from an early age i stay on this med to keep me stable. i have found when i've tried to come off anti depressants in past that i start to get depressed again. i see it as a condition i have to live with & maintain- a chemical inbalance in brain, so if meds help me to do that, then so be it! sometimes when overwhelmed at work, anxiety creeps in, but i find talking to a respected colleague helps alot & puts things back in perspective. i also did a course of 1 to 1 cognitive behavior therapy(cbt) which helped me alot in the long term to retrain your thinking so you dont get carried down the river to depression & anxiety. it makes you stop in your tracks before letting your mind making you overanxious about thoughts or situations & reevaluate that problem, & promotes what they call \"mindfullness\". its not patronising rubbish at all- it really helps in conjuction with meds for the long term future if you suffer from anxiety & depression, & i highly recommend you look into it. escitalopram is the best anti-d i have been on overall. i had one in the past that was good cant remember the name but it was withdrawn as it could cause heart problems so i had to change to citalopram which i didnt get on with, so went on to escitalopram which i do get on with. it doesnt cause me to sweat profusely like one of the older ones did, no side effects now at all, & i am mentally lucid, alert, & stable on this. Please hang in there for at least 4-6wks, & consider asking your gp for 1 to 1 cbt too. take care xx Hi Claire. I just took my 9th pill today (Cipralex Meltz 10mg). The first six days were the worst of my life. I experienced everything from brain zaps when I fell asleep to a constant \"charged\" feeling in my chest/back. Anxiety was through the roof. It was almost a tickle or excited feeling that you get from any daytime medication right above my adrenal glands. I certainly believe that some people are more sensitive than others as some people report no side effects at all! The only way that I was able to get myself through the first week was with Ativan (Lorazepam) that my doctor was kind enough to prescribe to me. I am taking this medication due to paralysing panic attacks. My ears had been ringing for over a month. I would also experience visual disturbances (flashy--similar to what some experience prior to a migraine headache) and pressure in my face and head. These were in addition to my mind descending into pure terror. Around the 4th and 5th day of taking Cipralex, my anxiety spiked even more! Since then, it has begun to decrease. I am feeling better but still experiencing some different/strange effects such as that tickly feeling I mentioned above, tremors inside my body, and my ears ring at different times now. I believe that I am still adjusting to the medication but that it is, in fact, helping. The Ativan has really been a life saver to get me through this first period of taking the medication. I definitely suggest staying in close contact with your GP as I find talking about the side effects that I'm experiencing with him helps so much! As my doctor pointed out to me, we've tested my heart, and blood and everything else and we know they are all fine. You are fine too. It's just the medication doing it's thing so try your very best to go with the flow and know and understand this is part of it and you will be okay. Maybe inquire about a small dose benzo to help you with the anxiety until the medication is able to kick in. Please feel free to reply here to me as talking about this I find helps a lot. Goodluck and hang in there!  Claire, I started this drug Monday 3 days ago..I have anxiety, sleep problems. lack of appetite and hot flashes..I am also on a drug for blood pressure and I also have diaharrea. I am miserable. I hope that this all will pass as I am trying to get my bp normal. This is even more nerve racking. Has yours subsided?  Hi Claire, I'm on day 5 at 10mg. I have all the symptoms you mentioned. I was told things get better and my anxiety today is a little better. How are you doing?"

          " <p>Hi Eleanor, do you feel any better at all in the weeks just following your injection? Or is the tiredness constant? I used to feel as though my batteries were running down once I got past 8 weeks. So I asked my GP if she was prepared to let me trial more frequent injections. She was happy to do this, and I now get my B12 injections every six weeks. It&#39;s made a huge difference to me. The other possibility is you are missing other vitamins, do you take a good quality B complex tablet? Have you had your VitD levels checked too? Mine was found to be low. You may be anaemic, or low in ferritin or folate, these are important in converting the injected B12 into something the body can use?</p><p>If you GP is unwilling to do further blood testing, there are private labs that you can use. In the first instance try your GP. More information can be found on The Pernicious Anaemia Society website. Best wishes Marion</p> Hi Eleanor, I had much the same problem and finally managed to convince my GP to allow me to have my injections every eight weeks instead of twelve. It did take some time and a lot of persuasion to get this result. I pointed out the website of the Pernicious Anaemia Society to her and it was the advice they give which finally convinced her. I have been much less tired since starting the new regime. Good luck. Jean  <p>Hi there,</p><p></p><p>It is not uncommon for some neurological symptoms to appear to get worse before they get better as the B12 begins to work repairing the damage done to your nervous system caused by the deficiency.</p><p></p><p>What is vitally important is that you have a healthy [b]Folate[/b] (B9 a.k.a folic acid) level as this is essential to process the B12 you are having injected. &#160;The two vitamins work together and the Folate gets &quot;used up&quot; by the B12.</p><p></p><p>Can you check with your doctor for the latest serum Folate test results as this will give you an indication of whether you need to supplement with folic acid.</p><p></p><p>I am not a medically qualified person but one who has had Pernicious Anaemia (a form of B12 Deficiency) for 45 years.</p><p></p><p>I wish you well</p> Have you checked your iron and magnesium levels? Hello Eleanor , i have the same problem , get b12 shot everty three months ,all my symptoms , cracked corners of lips , tiredness , pins and needlles , tinnitus ,light headiness ,constantly yawning / tired all day ,even black marks round my wedding ring ( possibly old wives tale , dont know ) remain. Convinced some ongoing b12 problem. Docs just says plain and simple that if you get b12 injections you are not b12 difficient. Im not convcinced as all my symptoms put down to b12 problem remain. Got to the stage wont go back to docs as i am embarrased.p.s all other bloods seemingly ok ruling out annemia ect."

          " <p>Yup- &#160;exhaustion, fatigue are part of Chiari. It&#39;s probably the most common symptom. Sleep Apnea is also connected with Chiari.

After you get all of the tests for everything else it could be, request a Cine MRI which detects CSF flow blockage. I went through all the tests too. Didn&#39;t find anything wrong. If I hadn&#39;t had the initial MRI stating I have Chiari 1, I would still be wondering what the heck was wrong with me. The CINE MRI showed I had complete blockage of CSF flow and so I had surgery.&#160;</p><p></p><p>Probably the only way you can see a NS sooner is if you pass out and get taken to the ER. &#160;Not that I&#39;m recommending it, but it works.&#160;</p><p></p><p>When you do see the NS, take someone with you who can help bolster your case and confidence so the lofty Docs don&#39;t try to manipulate you or blow off all your symptoms.

Get copies of all your tests and MRI&#39;s. Research Chiari so your are prepared. I had researched the comments made in my MRI report so I could have time to understand them.

I used to think it was because (for years) I have had severe iron anaemia (bad enough to give me a heart murmur and to require blood transfusions and iron infusions) and also had a bad issue with vitamin B12 deficiency. However, these things have been resolved now and yet I&#39;m still massively tired! All the time! Like you, it doesn&#39;t matter if I have 3...8...or 13 hours of sleep... I am still tired. I have no stamina at all. Even on the rare days I wake up feeling like I can get things done, I soon have to stop where I&#39;m so tired. </p><p>Having ruled out so many other things, I can only assume it&#39;s because of the chiari. No one seems to recognise it as a symptom though! So I end up questioning myself and wondering if I&#39;m just lazy when I see my neurologist or neurosurgeon! I know I&#39;m not though, because I never used to be like this. </p><p>It&#39;s horrible! </p><p>I think maybe it might be related to constantly being in pain? It might be more than that though, I don&#39;t know! </p><p>I don&#39;t have any advice I&#39;m afraid as still trying to work this all out myself... But wanted you to know you&#39;re not alone :-)</p><p>All I will say, is listen to your body and not other people. If you are tired, and finding things too much... Don&#39;t do it! You&#39;ll get to a point where your body will start shouting at you and that&#39;s not fun! If I over do things, I will not just be tired afterwards, I will be in severe pain for days. I&#39;m slowly learning that it&#39;s just not worth it and I have to take care of myself. </p><p>Take it easy x</p> <p>Hi, I have not posted for a while but I really relate to this I always thought I was just really lazy. But 2 years ago I was diagnosed Chiari 2, I try to keep going as long as I can I have managed to keep a full time job and my employer is great. But some days I have no choice but go to bed it is just not possible to stay up.&#160;</p><p></p><p>I do suffer with insominia wich is also a Chiari sypmton (i think) even when I do sleep I suffer from fatigue in the day. You just have to do what you can and listen to your body and learn when to stop, I have found it is not worth pushing too hard you just suffer for longer in the long run. I once was determined to sort my garden and worked too hard and then was unable to work for 2 weeks.</p><p></p><p>Today was my first duvet day off work&#160; suffering from &quot;zombie head&quot; in a year.</p> <p>I &#160;also read somewhere that Adderall helps with fatigue since it&#39;s a stimulant. Hard to say if your doctor would prescribe it for you.&#160;</p> <p>I felt like I wrote this post. Fatigue has been my worst enemy forever. The headaches started 6 years ago, then the dizzy spells followed, along with the other symptoms you mentioned and some. Some symptoms come and some symptoms go but the fatigue has been the absolute worst and has never left the building. It is a thorn in my side and I could sleep for a week straight if I didn&#39;t have a full-time job, husband, and 6 year old. I would fall asleep at my desk daily. Thank God I have a cool boss. The only thing that has remotely helped has been Adderrall or Vyvanse. It&#39;s for ADHD which is what I was diagnosed with before I knew I had Chiari. It also helped tremendously with the dizzy spells because it keeps my blood pressure elevated so that it doesn&#39;t drop every time I stand up. And it has also helped with the brain fog. My surgeon seems to think the fatigue is a result of all the other symptoms wearing me out and that fatigue itself is not an actual symptom. Nevertheless I&#39;m having decompression surgery December 6th because of the more serious symptoms but I am praying that the fatigue will go out the window along with all the other symptoms and then I can chunk the Adderrall in the trash but it has been my saving grace for the last year and a half. I hate taking meds, I&#39;ve tried about 5 different antidepressants before this all on which I stopped taking after a month. I was desperate to feel better and was willing to try anything but if it didn&#39;t help then I would stop taking it. Just wanted to share because I know the feeling. </p> <p>I can totally relate to this. Extreme exhaustion. I can sleep as much as I want but I always wake up exhausted as if I haven&#39;t slept in days. I also had an iron infusion as I was borderline anaemic but this didn&#39;t help with the tiredness. My gp mentioned something about chronic fatigue syndrome but I told her I wasn&#39;t interested and couldn&#39;t deal with another medical label at this point. </p><p></p><p>I have been tested for every other blood disorders under the sun &#128514; </p><p>I have found nothing to help so far. I am trying to concentrate on strengthening my muscles in the meantime and awaiting physiotherapy. </p>"

          " Hi I am in the same position as you, I have Atrial Eptopic Heart Beats ,it means i have extra Heart Beats single ,double and some triples a day,I have been given Atenolol, Verarapimil, both with only a small reduction in extra heart beats but both lowering my HeartBeat into the low 50s and Blood Pressure to 110/71 which is low.Now they want me to try Coversyl Perindopril which does Not seem to be used for irregular Heart Beats only Blood Pressure and Heart Attacks, so I have not even started taking them and I dont think I will unless someone on this site tells me they have been given this Drug for my condition, I suffer with Migrains so I dont want any more Headaches. sorry I seem to be negative but I feel like I am being used in a test trial . hope you get sorted out soon regards Roland Roland, Ive been on coversyl for 13 months from heart surgery (valve replacement) and have just realised that Im not going crazy, its just the side effects of this drug.. constant dizzyness, constant buzzing in the ears, bad temper, sometimes slightly depressed (not normal for me at all) and blurred vision.. Thankfully I found this web site and all your comments and am now off to my heart surgeon to get off Coversyl and find something else.. unusually enough I suffered from Migranes as long as I can remember, since the op Ive never had a headache, its wonderfull !!! Coversyl is reported to be a very good drug, and I dont doubt that, however, it doesnt seem to like me.. Hi Col and all you on Heart Drugs Col hope you have been given a better Drug, Here we are Jan 2008 and I am no futher to resolving my problem spent Boxing Eve in Hospital with Atrial Fibrilation and than a very slow irregular Heart Beat felt crap. will be seeing Cardiologist again for the 3rd time end of Jan, have been on Propranolol, Verapimil,Metaprolol,all of which slow my Heart into the 40/50 per min [b:0c39f42884]I tell the Doctors Do they listen ,They do not [/b:0c39f42884] hope this time for a result most of the Day feel crap Happy New Year to you all and hope you all get to live a near normal life. Roland:oops: Just found this site as I'm checking to see if my doctor's advice to double my Perindopril dosage to 8mg is safe. I've had high blood pressure most of my adult life (it runs in the family) &amp; suffered severe Atrial Fibrillation in 2000 which was misdiagnosed &amp; then mistreated....it was a debiltating, horrible experience. I've been on 4mg of Perindopril for probably 15yrs with no ill effects but it's not helped much in lowering my BP....beta blockers turned me into a constantly tired bear with a sore head so I'm happy to be on Perindopril as I get no side effects at all. My advice would be to constantly monitor what your doctor says &amp; (for me) beware of beta blockers. I'm resonably fit but yes, growing old sucks! Have been on perindopril for 6 months now (4mg), due hypertension. Side effects noted: After first tablet taken at night, heart racing all night and not much sleep. This settled down after a few nights. Since then: Often tiredness/fatigue/lethargy when not doing anything. Have to really motivate myself to do exercise, but once started seems fine. Cold fingers/2 numb fingers in right hand when temperature below about 14 degrees C. (worse than before on tablet) Blurred vision at times (particularly reading) Some throbbing inside head. Still have tinnitus. Sexual function very much decreased, erections a rare thing at present (yes, I know, TMI!). 1 skin rash (1cm square on abdomen), itches about twice a day. Plus side: Headaches greatly reduced, which used to happen regularly. Blood Pressure lowered by about 10 points on each. Motions very regular and smoother! (TMI again). Hi there, After reading other people's experience on BP tablets, I can appreciate what my husband is going through. He has been taking Coversyl 10mg for less than a year now, he has also complaint about the side effects he's been experiencing (ie buzzing in the ears, blur vision...mood swings). Most importantly is, it reduces his desire in having sex significantly, it makes both of us feeling depress towards this subject. As you may know, the more you feel frustrated and depress, the minimal the reaction. But we can't just simply stop taking the medication, whilst no doctor could precribe us with something better. Therefore, I wish to hear what other people have experienced, and how you dealt/dealing with it, or perhaps other natural remedies. Cheers, I started taking Coversyl about one month ago, The Doctor first prescribed 10mg which was too strong, I suffered headaches and neck pain. He has since reduced the dosage to one Coversyl 5mg at night. It works, my blood pressure is controlled and I feel great.  Question: why does everyone tell me i will never be able to stop this medication...does it damage the arteries? ... I was given this because of high blood pressure in the hospital emergency 4 days ago but was not really properly diagnosed...i'd prefer trying change of diet,exercise etc....any suggestions. I am new here, was on coversyl for over 10 years. I did have coughing problems for the first few months but it went away. I have been fighting wild Blood Pressure swings for about 10 months, from 225/153 to 72/48. Lately I started taking my PB in the morning, eating breakfast and taking it about one hour later. I ascertained after a few weeks that eating made my BP drop, at times very drastically. It also caused by bowels to empty which really curtailed by life style. After going to the doc, she was puzzled and ordered tests which I am going through this week. In the meantime I have stopped both my diuretic and coversyl and am careful about what food I eat. Much to my surprise all seems to be putting itself right. Have no idea why as everything was good for me for many years on this medication. Each one of us is different and it is only by trying that we can keep our BP in the normal range, Too high is very bad. I have been taking Coversyl for the past year and I have done extensive research on the all comparable blood pressure meds before starting. I can say indefinitely that this agent has the most evidence on the market in terms of life saving benefits and lowest chance of side effects. I am sure there will be a handful that do not tolerate Coversyl, but from what I have researched the risk is worth the reward. Rest assured you are on good stuff! I've been taking coversyl for about two years, mostly 8 mg but have recently convinced my doctor to reduce my dose to 4 mg. My side effects are problems with close up vision. Also noticing veins on my face. Salt seems to be the enemy for me and causes my BP to spike. Would like to get off drugs completely.  Dear Guest: I was reading your post, and it is as if I was reading something I would have written. I felt like you throughout my 40's and up until Sept. of this year. I had high BP. The doctor gave me pills, they sat in the cabinet. I was terrified, and my medical colleagues all told me to take pills. I tried diet and exercise but it didn't change my BP. I had a stressful job too. Then, in Sept. I had a small stroke in my early 50's. The emergency doctor gave me Coversyl 2 mg. and aspirin. My husband got the prescription, a glass of water and handed me the pills. Well, now I take them once a day. My heart works easier now, my blood pressure is no longer high. I can't say I have any other side effects that I notice. I have a sensory deficit in my left side from the stroke. It's permanent. I say, take the pill before the blood pressure damages your brain vessels. Yes, I can't believe it myself..getting old is nasty. Good luck, and write how you feel after.. Cheers.  <p>Hi, i&#39;m 41 and have been diagnosed with HBP (hereditary &amp; life enduced stress) about 1.5 year ago, doctor started me off with 4mg, then bumped me up to 8mg.</p><p></p><p>Systolic 155 146 143 150 151 142 135 146</p><p>Diastolic 109 107 100 104 94 97 88 88</p><p>Pulse 98 88 92 119 110 96 109 109</p><p></p><p>At this point i have the hottest g/f but 3/4 of the time i loose my erections during intercourse, it&#39;s never happened to me before and i&#39;m sure Coversyl is the cause <img src=\"http://s8.patient.media/forums/emoticons/sad.gif\" alt=\"sad\" /> in addition, my sex drive has diminished severely to the point that she&#39;s wondering if i&#39;m cheating on her or something <img src=\"http://s8.patient.media/forums/emoticons/sad.gif\" alt=\"sad\" /></p><p></p><p>Doctor told me all medication for HBP are more or less the same, that Coversyl is the best one. Still, i&#39;m not ready to give up on my relationship because of HBP..any suggestions?</p> <p>Hi all,</p><p>[b]?[/b]i have only this moment come across this site it is Aug 2016 and i live in Australia, the stories all seem like i have written them at some stage over the last 5 years, my incident started the way as most,in denial and thought i could beat the HBP through diet or whatever.I have a high pressure job at times in the Construction industry as a site manager say no more. Dec 22 2011 building industry christmas shutdown known as breakup day,didn&#39;t even make it to work that day, thought i was having a heart attack,felt like some alien beast was trying to rip my heart out through my back,the only comfort i could find until the ambulance arrived was to arch my back and not move a millimetre,ambulance came did what all good paramedics do and made me comfortable and proceeded to take all the nessesary tests to determine the cause of the discomfort,my blood pressure at that point was 235/180 forget what my pulse was,tests showed i wasnt having a heart attack but something was seriously wrong,I live a long way from the hospital,the quickest trip ive ever done.</p><p>[b]?[/b]Emergency dept took me in and examined and tested and tested some more to a point where they almost decided to send me home and see if things changed over a period of time,a young Dr suggested lets try a&#160;CT scan and see what that shows ill never know who he was but i owe him my life the CT scan revealed an Aortic Dissection running the full lenght of my Aorta from the arch down into my groin,so of course emergency surgery open heart the whole bit. five years later im still here to tell my tale, Coversyl, five years&#160;ive been on blood pressure medication and i would have to say its taken me the best part of four years to get my head into a place where i can function as a husband,father and work a full time job&#160;back in the building industry.&#160;coversyl&#160;10 mg twice a day&#160;is where im at now with another drug called Zanidip,minipress and metoprolol these four drugs keep me alive and i must say again i has taken four years to accept the drugs. the lethargy,the dizziness, the lack of motivation,i have a constant heart rate of between 38 beats per minute to an absolute high of 60,at that level im peaking and it feels like im about to explode</p><p>[b]?[/b]however sex was also an issue not being to get an erection to getting one and then losing interest half way through to not even thinking about it at all.slowly over time i accepted my situation and accepted that my body can funtion at a lower heart rate and i accepted that i may not have the best sex life,and i accepted that i was in control of my life and i wasnt going to die in the next week or so,suprisingly i sit here five years later writing this story, So Coversyl is a good drug, it takes time to get used to it,&#160;if you feel that you cannot cope with the drug please see your doctor and&#160;ask them if there is an alternative,again changing medications take time to adjust to,I dread the day i have&#160;to add or change my meds,its a long road to feeling normal again,my blood pressure these days is 145/90 when i get home from work down to 115/75 about one and a half hours after i medicate which i do twice a day im 58 years of age and im happy that i have drugs like coversyl ,its only years ago people died of complications that we now live with, thanks to pharmaceutical companies and brillliant doctors we have lot to be grateful for and taking pills for the rest of my life isn&#39;t too bad when i can still be part of my family and watch my children grow up and share the good&#160;times with my wife. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>"

          "Hi - I've just this morning taken my first dose of Coversyl, only 2mg, but will probably be increased in a couple of weeks and possibly another drug added. Now I feel like I'm just sitting here waiting for nasty side-effects to happen, and am quite frightened, so I wanted to see what experiences other people have had. My BP has been untreated, but very high for some years, and it is possible I have LVH (echo in 2 weeks to confirm). I have had these tablets nearly a month but put them away in a cupboard as I was too scared to take them. Am I the only person who has built up a huge psychological block about having to start medication that will continue for the rest of my life? I feel it might change me and my life, but I also know what the consequences of not lowering BP would be. Doesn't getting older suck?! :("

          " Yes. That's pretty much what thyroid disease is like. I've given standing orders to my support system people, that when I call them all freaked out and unable to think straight, to reply with, \"how's your medication?\" As FOR ME, the symptoms you describe are always due to my medication being too low... Usually following my trying to lower them. Look, nobody wants to be on meds for life. It sucks. But thyroid medication is very complicated and dose changing needs to be slowly if you're decreasing. The meds are very difficult to regulate because they take about three months to completely level out. If you retest too soon after increasing the dosage, you'll get a spike in your numbers (your body is still adjusting) that will make it look higher than it will be if you wait to test for three months after changing the meds. However, what medication are you taking? You were on 75mcg? When did you change it? You say you were overmedicating. What blood work was done? What were the results? What was the basis for the \"overmedicating? What were the symptoms before and after changing the medication? How long were the symptoms for? Do you have any other health problems? I hate to ask the obvious, but there are certain health problems that seem to run paralelle with thyroid disease. Sometimes it helps to keep a journal. Unfortunately, withthe brain fog, I understand that this is nearly impossible. Also, to keep in mind, different people react differently to different medications. I had horrible symptons and constant headaches withthe synthetics.Horrible migrains when the dose was too low. Hope that helps. Good luck!  I have had those same feelings daily for a few months. I am on thyroid meds and have a lesion on my pituitary gland. I have been told by doctor that that should not cause the tightness I feel every day in my head. I also have severe tinnitus which again have been told should not cause this pain/tightness in my head. The feeling in my head is very annoying and worrisome. CT head scan does not indicate a cause for this. I am stumped. Anybody have these same feelings just so I know I am not going crazy. Hi, I am new to the forum. I am so glad that someone else is having similar issues with this medication, I was on 112MCG and after regular blood test my Endocronologist advise that I was over medicated and therefore adjusted the dosage to 75MG, but I noticed that I am having the same strange head sensations, I am not having another issues yet. I am on this new dosage since October 3. I just want this headache or head sensation to go away. My next appoint is in December and a blood to be taken 1 week before seeing the doctor, I will discuss with the doctor on my next visit. I thought I was have a brain tumor, It is great hearing that someone else is having the same issue. Thanks for your post I somewhat feel a bit better that I am not alone and not crazy."

          " <p></p><p>I have a constant 24/7 migraine. Anyone got any ideas for relief?</p><p>Posted 4 days ago</p><p>I am a 57 year old woman (through menopause - last period 7/2014). On 4/5/2010 I woke up with a migraine. I&#39;d had them on and off for about 25 years but they never lasted more than 3 days or so. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve still got that 4/5/2010 headache. It changes location and early on the severity ranged from a 6 to a 10. They are now only a 9 or 10 on the pain scale. I have had every test run and tried every medication. I have been to UCLA Medical Center and the Diamond Headache Clinic in Chicago (for a week). I&#39;ve had pain blocks, epidurals, tens units etc. I live on Dilaudid (56mg a day). We are currently testing for the right pain med to use in an implanted pain pump. I had to quit work 5 years before my retirement date. I would have had 30 years in working for the state of Calif. I had a problem after I had a spinal tap because apparently I was supposed to be told to go home and lay flat (not even a pillow) for days. Because I didn&#39;t, the puncture didn&#39;t heal and I leaked spinal fluid. That was not the cause of the migraines, the tap was done during the diagnosis process for the migraines. The only thing that helps a tiny bit is botox from my headache specialist. All it does is make the pain meds work a little bit better. Please if you know of anything that might help. The nights that I do sleep, maybe 3 nights a week I am honestly sad to awaken the next day. My life is nothing but sadness and Dr appts. The only thing that keeps me alive is knowing it would destroy those I&#39;d leave behind. Take care and God bless.sorry for errors but my head is killing me. &#128546;</p><p></p> <p>Good morning Amber99286.</p><p>OMG! I haven&#39;t suffered what you&#39;ve gone thru but what does your MRI show? Any lesions on the brain? &#160;At first I of course thought MIA&#39;s, then I thought MS. Do you wear glasses?</p><p>I immediatley prayed for you after reading your story. Please don&#39;t give up, help is on the way! &#160;</p><p>Iodine salt, sudden bright lights and chocolates are my migraine triggers. I make sure I have my sunglasses with me at all times! I one pair in the car and one pair in my purse and one pair in my desk at work! Lights are a killer!</p><p>So sorry you&#39;re going thru this and I pray that relief comes very soon for you so that you can enjoy life and your wonderful boyfriend!</p> <p>Hi Amber</p><p>I suffer with migraines and I suffer with my neck because I have a bulging disk in my lower back and scoliosis and now athritis!!</p><p>I was doing a media course last year and finished this June..</p><p>I can tell you being in front of a computer</p><p>DID NOT HELP ME Attall. I feel it&#39;s drastic to have to say this but computers do not help your eye sight or your head or your neck or back..</p><p>Since I have stopped glaring at a computer doing my course I have had great relief..</p><p>But sometimes we have to do something drastic to get a better result..sorry&#128577;</p> <p>No Amber, you are not alone. This forum has helped me realize that. So many suggestions and still no answers seems to be common, but at least it&#39;s reassuring to know their are others. I&#39;d give you my history, but it would sound like many others. I now feel I&#39;m just getting worse not better. So I too am still searching, hoping something will change. I have tried Botox, 3 times, no help. I hope maybe for you it will help. Maybe try a good pain management clinic. I have found a system that makes it bearable, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m just having rebound headaches, so by helping, I&#39;ve just made it worse. So hang in there, you always have this forum to come to. And just like you said, if people only knew us when ....</p> <p>hi Amber. I too suffered similar migraine but with other ill health symptoms. It was so awful and painful and no one seemed to understand it. Neurologists were no use to me.&#160;</p><p></p><p>12 years ago I was diagnosed with an auto immune disorder. This was the cause of my continual migraine. I am now disease free (not &#39;cured&#39; as there is no cure for what I have) but symptom free due to medication.&#160;</p><p></p><p>If you have other symptoms going on which you may or may not relate to the migraine please consider exploring this avenue. This area is so poorly understood.&#160;</p><p></p><p>I have a form of vasculitis (I have Behcet&#39;s but there are other forms of vasculitis). A lot of people with vasculitis have this migraine syndrome. It is caused by inflammation which is why it doesn&#39;t respond to conventional treatments.&#160;</p><p></p><p>I think you should have this ruled out. Ask for your inflammatory markers and ANA to be checked. If there is anything in there then ask for a referral to an appropriate consultant and not a neurologist. Speak with vasculitis UK about your symptoms. Free helpline.&#160;0300 365 0075. They will speak to you and offer support and advice.&#160;</p><p></p><p>I have no idea if this could be what you have going on but I would want to have it ruled out. It often developsin early 20&#39;s and has a wide variety of possible symptoms.&#160;</p>"

          "Hi All I wanted to write my own story on here in hope that I can communicate with people that are going through the same thing, or have been through the same thing, and would take the time on reassuring the ones who are still on this nightmare of a journey that things can get better. I am a 23yr old Female, my headache started March 2015, and ever since I havent had a moment without it. My headache feels like a very tight pressure all around my head - like my head is being squeezed hard. I have sore areas on my scalp. My face is numb + tingley(feels like little bugs are running across my face) and also my face can feel like its drooping when its physically not. I have all the symptoms of migraine - light/sound sensitivity, and also smells make me feel sick. My eyes constantly ache. I get a throbbing pressure in my gums and behind my nose and also feel pressure in my ears (like when you are on plane). I developed tinnitus a month after my headache and it hasnt stopped ever since. My neck, shoulders and top of my back constanly ache like hell to - which doesnt help when my job consists of sitting at a computer 8 hours a day! I have seen 3 neurologists - one diagnosing me with chronic tension headache, the most recent 2 I have seen have told me chronic daily Migraine. I have tried Amytriptaline,Nortriptyline,Propranalol, and Candersartan (Apologies for the spellings)- these have had no effect at all. I have had the steroid injections in my head which gave me no relief. I have bought a mouth guard from the dentist as she said it sounds like I am grinding my teeth at night- after a few months of wearing this I didnt notice any difference. I saw a Chiropractor who told me my neck is pushing forwards and blamed my headache on this, but after 4 months of attending 3 times a week I felt no different. I have recently payed to find out if i have any food intolerences - which came back that I had, but after cutting out the foods I felt no different. I really am sick of false hope and really am at my witts end. I am waiting on an appointment for my first botox injections. Im finding it so hard to lead a normal life with this and often have suicidal thoughts. The only thing that stops me if the thought of leaving my loved ones behind. Its a nightmare trying to work full time with this, but also know if I claimed any disability allowences it would certainly make things easier by not having to be stressed at work, but would mean no money to pay bills - this would lead to more stress. I feel so trapped and feel like im never going to feel ok again. I now suffer from anxiety + depression. It really effects my relationship with my boyfriend as I am always down and miserable, and we can never do things togther because of my head. I met him 10 months ago when I had the headache, so he has never really met the real me! I feel no one understands apart from the people I have been speaking to on this site, but everyones story is different. I really need some words of wisdom, and to know even though I feel so lonely, I am not alone. Can anyone out there please offer any advise or share anything that has helped you? I cannot bear the thought of living like this for the rest of my life, and refuse to! Thanks for taking the time to read my post I look forward to hearing from other people that are also suffering from this awful disease! Amber x"
