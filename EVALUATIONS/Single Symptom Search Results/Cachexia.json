          " Thank yo so much for this posting, Susan. I've been searching for some article or blog that addressed alternatives to the doctor's \"Everyone gets it\" attitude, and pain medication prescription. And I have found a few snippets that have helped, but nowhere did I see someone say there was the possibility of reversing it. I was diagnosed with early diabetes II, some years ago. Same attitude from the doctor,same old mantra from the dietitician, which I rejected. I am vegetarian, and went after the disease with a vengeance. I believe in fighting back. Found Neal Barnard's \"Reversing Diabetes\". Five years later I am still diabetes free. So now let's get down to the battle with the pain in my hip which in fact is really a pain in my groin muscle that radiates to the hip which they named Osteoarthritis a couple of months ago. I've been very active all my life, and will not go quietly. Please share some more if you can. Particularly any reading matter out there. Hi Fran, It's hard to know where to start!! There is of course no way of knowing what exactly is wrong with you. The only way to find out if it's a curable muscle imbalance is to try and fix it. But I must warn - it's not easy. Health professionals don't have the training. Physios etc have the necessary background but not the in-depth training. I think it'd definitely be worth putting a lot of effort into if you're willing as, based upon my research, I would guarantee that a lot of the symptoms experienced by EVERYONE with OA will be soft tissue problems and therefore treatable. So I would suggest that everyone can benefit greatly from putting effort into correcting their muscle imbalances - if nothing else to stop your arthritic hip from screwing up the rest of your body! I suppose the best place to start is describe what turned out to be wrong with me. For years I struggled blindly with physios, chiros etc. More recently I started to study the biomechanics in depth myself and gradually tracked down the cause. You say a pain in your groin muscle - snap! :) The first thing in the trail was I realised my pelvis was a bit twisted. One of my legs felt longer than the other. I researched this, found diagnositc information and determined that I had a 'Right on Right Sacral Torsion'. Essentially this means that your sacram (the bit of your spine that the two wings of the pelvis are attached to) was twisted out of place and 'stuck' there. Your sacrum, along with the wings of your pelvis (innominates) move throughout normal gait. If your muscles get a bit out of whack (through overuse, bad posture etc) the sacrum and therefore the entire pelvis can stay stuck. The innominates (wings of the pelvis) move in relation to the sacrum. If the sacrum sticks so do the innominates. In my case (r on r sacral torsion) my right innominate was stuck in inflare, posterior rotation and downslip. In addition, when the sacrum tilts and rotates one way, the lumber spine tilts and rotates the opposite way, and the thoracic spine moves opposite to lumber spine. The dysfunction subtly spreads through your body. It may not be immediately obvious if this is the case with you. But I suspect most people will have some kind of pelvic dysfunction with hip OA - either cause or effect. I can provide resourses and explain in more detail later. But essentially, with the boney structure of your pelvis out of place, all the muscles (which connect pelvis to femur and control the movement at the hip) are under abnormal strain. The distance between the muscle attachment points is altered and skewed. Some muscles are stretched too tight, some too slack and some in positions where they are disadvantaged and can't work properly. The body is highly adaptive and recruits whatever muscles it can to get the job done. But this can lead to joint wear and pain in time - as well as restricted range of motion. There are lots of online explanations on how to diagnose a dysfunction like this, and how to treat it. But treatment won't always be easy. The problem can be well established and tricky. I did the recommended corrective exercises and got noticeable improvements. But progress stalled. It became apparent to me that the current most limiting problem was the inflare. Basically, the right pelvic bone was rotated out of place and pointing inwards too much. Not noticeable to the naked eye. This made it difficult for my gluteus maximus (big muscle in your backside) to engage properly. I tried digging my fingers under the bone at the front of my pelvis and pulling it outwards. Miraculously my gluteus muscle was suddenly strong - my hip moved properly. It wasn't down to me moving the innominate into position though. There's a muscle (actually a pair of muscles) known as the illiapsoas. It's a hip flexor and also a major core stabiliser. A very important muscle. Both bits attach to the top of your thigh bone (so it may be what you consider your groin muscle). One part - the iliacus - attaches at the other end to the inside of the pelvic bone. The other part - the psoas - attaches to the spine. My iliacus had gone into spasm. This is what was causing the restricted range of motion and the 'hard end feel' that is indicative of OA. When I tried to move my innominate into position I inadvertently dug my fingers into the muscle which caused it to 'deactivate' - temporarily come out of spasm in a way. Immediately weak muscles were stronger, hip rom improved, hard end feel changed to springy, normal end feel and the discomfort went away. It was only when digging my fingers in though. The moment I took my fingers away the problems came back. This was clearly the cause of the problem. But how to release the muscle? It proved to be impossible. I was missing something. Quite by chance (discussing something with a training partner) it occured to me that my right psoas (the other part of the iliapsoas muscle) simply wasn't working. It didn't fire. THIS was the root cause of my 8 year problem. The psoas is a major hip flexor and a significant stabiliser. Without it my body was jumping through hoops trying to stabilise me and lift my right knee. Probably as a protective mechanism my nervous system put the iliacus muscle into a spasm - because I was dangerously unstable. It wouldn't release until the psoas started working again. It's a bit tricky getting dysfunctional muscles working properly again, but very doable. The diagnosis is the hard bit. Once you roughly figure it out most physios can help. I'll go dig out some resources that you might find helpful in tracking down the root of your problem (or at the very least, minimising your symptoms). There are lots of other possible scenarios, but probably checking things out along these lines is a good place to start. I'll post back later with some useful links. If you have any specific questions please ask. I plan to put this on a website at some point to share all I've learned with others in a similar situation.  Thank you so much for your quick response. Everything you said here makes sense to me. In fact I can dig my fingers into a particular spot and stop pain. Sitting appears to be the worst trigger for pain...when I stand up. I am a writer (and painter) and spend a lot of my time sitting. Walking is not usually a problem, although it is if I've overtired myself earlier. I can position myself, especially lying down, to have no pain at all. Religning myself temporarily? This groin \"pull\" happened years ago, and I've always favoured it. Every few years I reinjure it. It flared up again just six months ago when we moved house and I got way too physical. I am very strong, well-muscled, and have always prided myself on my strength, so this situation is particularly frustrating. This morning, before I read your posting, I woke up pain free. This is a first in weeks. It's this that makes mine think I am somehow just out of alignment. If it were true joint damage, would the pain not be there all the time, mild or severe? It sounds very promising for a soft tissue problem. Certainly an injury will cause you to make adaptations to avoid pain from the injury and those adaptations can become permanent and eventually lead to pain. In actual fact, this is considered by the 'experts' to be a possible cause of some cases of arthritis. The adaptations around the injury can cause the joint to track abnormally and ultimately cause it to wear. However, even if it has caused your joint to wear (evidence of degenerative changes on x-ray) this is pretty irrelevant. Very many people have degenerative changes in joints without symptoms. It's a perfectly normal and painless part of being alive! Fix the imbalance, get the joint tracking normally and the wear stops. Along with the symptoms. Yours may be far less complex than my problem. Have you heard of trigger points? This is one possibility that's very easy to rule out. In fact, again, very many/most/all? people with OA are likely to have trigger points that may be causing all/some/most ? of their symptoms. It's worth looking at. There are reported cases of people being booked for joint replacement surgery that have been able to cancel it after treating trigger points. There's a very good book, which I have : http://www.triggerpointbook.com/ But large portions of this book are online: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DLb7ShX-gskC&printsec=frontcover&dq=trigger+point+workbook&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oKL2UpCaE8KXhQfxnYGwBw&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=trigger%20point%20workbook&f=false Basically, you look up where you hurt and it'll tell you where you're likely to find trigger points that refer pain to that point. If the trigger point is the primary cause of your pain it's possible that massaging the trigger point will get rid of it permanently. But I personally think it more likely in most cases that the trigger point is there because the muscle is being strained due to imbalance. It'll keep coming back until you address the imbalance. They say that joint pain is worse on activity and better at rest. But that first getting moving after rest the joints can be stiff for 20 mins or so. But that's true of other things too. Anyway, I don't think they actually know for sure that OA pain has anything to do with the joints. People feel it in all sorts of places indicating that it's actually soft tissue pain. Some people have virtually disintegrated joints and no pain or symptoms. Others have bad pain and next to no joint wear. This indicates to me that OA is not always a genuine joint problem. Far more likely that the joint wear is the result of muscle dysfunction - or movement impairment. I'll post some other things to explore later. As a writer that sits a lot psoas and iliacus are strong contenders for at least being involved. The psoas can shorten and cause all sorts of problems. I'm a software engineer so also did lots of sitting. Also practiced martial arts and weightlifting for 20 years. The combination of intense exercise and lots of sitting is a bit of a recipe for disaster (in that the muscle don't like it and are liable to complain in time)!!  I have replied fran, but as there was a link in my post it needs to be cleared by a moderator. Not sure how long that'll take.  I look forward to it. Thank you. Hi both, Sorry for the delay in getting round to this. I have approved the links in this case but for future reference if you post your reply then post any links in a separate post this saves waiting for the whole comment to be approved. Alternatively post your comment then use the message service to exchange the links. This is the better way of doing it in case the links are not approved if they are to commercial sites etc. Regards, Alan Emis Moderator  Thanks for the link...will buy this book. So many areas covered other than the hip, and we all get pain in those places too, - shoulders, back, neck - from time to time. I am very encouraged by everything you've said. If, in the end, this is not helpful to me, I have lost nothing by trying. It certainly can't make this discomfort (understatement) worse. I appreciate the amount of research you've done on the subject...probably years of work, and you share this so freely. I'll stay in regular touch, of course, and look forward to further information from you as we go. Fran Fran  It's a very good book. One of the few that I've used repeatedly over the years. I'm not sure what to tell you next. Maybe if you let me know what your symptoms are and if anything sounds familiar I can tell you what might be worth trying next? Inability to lift you knee to your chest (or opposite shoulder) is a common one? Maybe pinching or soreness in the groin? If you have that, have a feel about and see what muscles are active as you lift your knee. It's easiest to do when lying on your back. I know that's tricky if you don't know what you're looking for. Just compare the two hips and see if there's anything different - a muscle that's very active on one side but not the other perhaps? The reason I mention this is because this is a common symptom. Yet in me the problem was that the main hip flexor (psoas) wasn't working correctly and the iliacus, adductors, TFL and rectus femoris were taking over. This makes the leg pull to one side and causes groin pain and restricted movement. It's tricky, but if this is happening to you, with practice you can get the over-active muscles to shut down and the knee tracks nicely to the chest then (or it did with me). If this is familiar let me know and I'll explain more. Or else let me know any other symptoms and I'll pass on all that I've discovered that's relevant.  I forgot an important bit of info! The thing that finally got me moving in the right direction enough to figure this out was diaphragmatic breathing. It sounds ridiculous, I know. I was skeptical. The reason that it can be so helpful is that by breathing deep into your diaphragm you activate all the pelvic floor muscles, and help activate chains of muscles going up and down from your pelvis. It's just the way muscles are connected. So it can help get your muscles balanced and working correctly even when you haven't got a clue what's wrong. Look up Postural Restoration Institute. Have a good read - look at some of their articles. For example, the ones on AF IR - these really help you to understand how muscle imbalances can pull the actual hip joint out of alignment and make it stiff, sore and even worn in time. There are also articles explaining how muscle imbalance can lead to hip impingement - they're worth a read too. It just lets you really grasp the relevance. Physios/doctors etc don't have a problem grasping that pain and restriction (and even degenerative changes) in a shoulder are frequently due to a shoulder impingement which is the result of muscle imbalances in the thoracic spine/scapular. Very fixable. Yet when someone has hip pain they NEVER consider the possibility it's down to muscle imbalances in the pelvis (EXACTLY mirroring common shoulder problems) - they always jump straight to OA. I think this (Postural Restoration Institute articles - and read their 'science' page) was probably what led me to my breakthrough that finally solved everything. OK, Susan. Digesting, weighing, analysing everything. Will check out that institute. I'm taking it slow, not quite believing that answers could be out there, but feeling strongly that they are. And I love your shoulder/hip comparison. This really does say it all. I'm even more confident after looking at the hip chapter of that book...where they describe areas affected, symptoms. Stay in touch. Don't go anywhere. Hi Susan, Found it difficult to navigate the Institute's website. In order to register, it seems I must sign up for a professional course. Is this right? I did learn about the breathing technique, which is a whole new take on wellness, but really want to see the exercises. The book will not be here for a couple of weeks (I'm in Australia) so I'll have to be patient. In the meantime, I'm already feeling much better about the discomfort. I have taken charge of it, think of it as a \"thing\" that needs to be confronted. How strange the mind is - from feeling like a victim, I now feel like a warrior. I look forward to being the first follower of your blog, so get started please. (I'm a pro, if you have questions about that!) One thing I'm missing from you. I can't see where you mention how long it took you, from the time you identified the apparent cause of your pain, to your successful outcome. And did you, and do you now, practice the techniques on a daily basis?  Found the exercises! Pictures, but no instructions. I'll keep looking. I've been battling with this for 8 years. Making some progress with the help of various physios etc, but it never really got to the heart of the matter. I didn't have bad pain - but very bad stiffness - very restricted range of motion. Then about 6 months ago I developed sciatica. It kept getting worse. For a month or two around christmas time it was REALLY bad. I knew it was because of the twist in my pelvis. I couldn't do much else so I started searching full time for the answer. I guess it's only been in the last couple of months that I've started to figure this out. First the twisting in my pelvis - got some results dealing with that. Discovering the iliacus spasm and psoas dysfunction was only very recently. It's just unraveled it all so quickly. But I had to figure it out first - that's the hard bit. I guess you could say that took 8 years! Now I'm back doing karate kicking - low kicks - only about waist height, but flexibility is improving every day and it's very comfortable. I actually tried to buy course material from the PRI - they wouldn't let me. They say it's only for health and fitness professionals. Ridiculous!! You'll find some exercises if you look through the articles. But without knowing what's wrong with you how are you going to select the right exercise? I think this site can only give you clues. If there are any positions you find difficult you could try holding that position and 'breathing into it', if that makes sense? It's heavy going, but if you think you might have some twisting in your pelvis (normally you would if you have muscle imbalances) this can help you figure it out. http://osteopedia.iao.be/uploads/ilium_e.pdf I can't say it was easy to figure out. It is complicated. Getting an understanding of what's going on with your body is the first - and the hardest part. Your problem won't be the same as mine - mine was caused by doing karate. From what you've said, there's a possibility yours is a result of the injury you had a while back. But maybe the basic mechanisms are the same. I can only really tell you about what worked for me. "

          "If you're a proactive individual that's been diagnosed with incurable Osteoarthritis it's *possible* that you can in fact beat the diagnosis and get back to full fitness and functionality. It happened to me. I should add that I was diagnosed at age 42 and was very fit and active at the time. I think it might be very different for older individuals, people who's condition is advanced, or people that don't enjoy exercise. Here's my story. I can't make any promises that it'll be the same for you. But I will if people are interested share some of the resources that helped me to beat what I considered to be a life shattering diagnosis, for which I was assured there was no possibility of a cure. I don't know whether to believe I was misdiagnosed and never actually had Osteoarthritis, or whether they're wrong when they say Osteoarthritis is incurable. What I can say is that I was told my symptoms were 'classic' and that the diagnosis was certain - that my symptoms couldn't be explained by anything else. The whole area is so poorly defined and slap-dash that it's impossible to tell. Either way, it means there's at least hope of beating it if that's what you want to try and do. I've spent 8 years battling against the people that were hell bent on brow beating me into believing I had Hip Osteoarthritis when I knew I didn't. My real problems were ignored - I was essentially left to rot. I was treated like an idiot. Told I researched too much. That I was in denial. Told that I was making my problems worse by training to keep myself fit, strong and active. Told I should swim and cycle and give up all other sports. I was asked repeatedly \"You've had numerous experts try to help you - don't you think one of them would have succeeded if this really was curable?\". Finally I've been vindicated. I figured it out for myself. A simple, treatable muscle imbalance causing all of my problems. Obviously I wanted to let the people know that have tried to help over the years. I expected them to be amazed - a breakthrough that could help lots of people. These cases that we think are incurable can in fact be fixed!! My excitement was met with apathy: [paraphrasing]. \"The reality is that most people are inactive and unwilling to put in the work needed to address muscle imbalances like this. Even if the correct diagnosis was made, for most people the end result would be the same. People who are willing to put in the work necessary to reverse the condition are so few and far between that they aren't statistically significant to make it worth the cost of training and research. We were unable to solve your problem because we've not been adequately trained to do so. But well done for hanging in and figuring it out yourself.\" Why wasn't I told this BEFORE I discovered the solution for myself? Why did they try to convince me I had incurable OA when they knew how determined I was to beat it? Here's the reality as I now understand it (as it's been explained to me). This may not reflect every health professionals view, but it is a summary of what I've been told by various health professionals: GP's are responsible for diagnosing OA. Yet they know very little about bio mechanics (unless they've got an interest and educate themselves). They don't understand the condition in great detail, but they don't need to. They're working to a script. It seems not to be widely known who writes that script (so who to go to with questions or doubts)...which is a little bit of a worry. Some know that often it's a misdiagnosis - more forward thinking GP's are aware that it's frequently a treatable soft tissue issue. But like the physios, think it doesn't matter too much as for most patients it makes no difference. They lead inactive lifestyles and any attempts to restore them to full functionality will fail. There is little point in wasting resources trying to give an accurate diagnosis when the end result will usually be the same regardless. So OA is the 'catch all' category you put them in. There is no cure - you manage with drugs and operate if and when necessary. Even when someone is in great shape, keen to be proactive in their treatment and has an active lifestyle worth preserving there's nothing to be gained in finding the correct diagnosis as there is no one to refer them to to get it fixed. People worth bothering with (because they can be restored to a good, active life) aren't statistically significant enough to be worth the research and training needed to put systems in place to help them. So, the GP's make the OA diagnosis despite not necessarily knowing much about OA. Who are the specialists then if you're determined to find the real cause of your joint stiffness or pain? Well, there's a bit of an oversight there. There is no one. Orthopedic surgeons know about surgery. If your problem is an easily curable soft tissue issue they probably won't know enough to detect it. They may well put you under the knife unnecessarily. Or tell you that you have an incurable problem that will deteriorate over time - that your active life is over (that's what happened to me). But this is more a case of them forcing your problem into something that fits their specialist knowledge. Not a proper diagnosis. Then there's physios. They aren't trained to detect and treat curable soft tissue problems that lead to joint wear and might otherwise be diagnosed as OA. However, some are better than others. Some might actually be very capable. It's pot luck. I think it's unlikely to find someone with these skills working for the NHS, but I may be wrong. I have been told (by a physio) that the failure rate in these cases is 99% within the NHS. There are people out there that do know how to diagnose and treat these soft tissue problems. And there's plenty of info on this on the internet that you can use to help yourself. It's down to the individual to separate the wheat from the chaff. Contrary to what we are led to believe, OA isn't an incurable degenerative disease. Strictly speaking it doesn't exist. It's a 'catch all' diagnosis used to put people with joint problems in when there aren't resources and training to find out and fix what's really wrong with them. Contrary to what we're led to believe, there is no category of the medical profession with expertise in the multitude of conditions commonly labeled as OA. If you think you've seen an expert and had a reliable diagnosis of OA - think again. There is no easy fix - that's true. There is no way of knowing if yours is a curable soft tissue problem without trying to fix it. I'm led to believe that official research into OA is centered around keeping this 99% of people that are deemed incurable (because they are perceived to be inactive and unwilling or unable to adhere to the required rehab plan), as pain free and independent as possible at minimum cost. It's simply not cost effective to put time and effort into finding the cause, the cure, or training people to make diagnosis and cure soft tissue problems in the cases where how to do so is already known by some. But there are people out there that have figured out how to diagnose and cure at least some of these cases. Some speculate that all OA is initially a soft tissue dysfunction. However, this is mainly in the private sector - or perhaps in the NHS, but on an unofficial level. You're faced with the dilemma of separating the fakes from the real deal. Most will claim to be able to help - and many will diagnose incurable OA when they fail. That doesn't necessarily mean you can't be helped. Many tried and failed with me before I figured it out for myself. But if you're willing to work at it yourself - or maybe even find the right person (which is very difficult) then it is quite possible that what you have is very curable."

          " Hi terryw, Without sounding harsh all the stats around the web are fine but the bottom line is you may! Have cancer and the sooner you find out the better it can be dealt with, hopefully successfuly. My psa was 5.2 after biopsy gleason 3,3 (6) after removal T2c RO NO MARGINS This all took place within 2 months diagnosis to removal. Agree not all like to move so quickly but if it is confirmed pads are better than departure from this life. Don't be afraid of thr biopsy the risks are a lot less than the alternatives should you go on undiagnosed and then find iys to late! ! I am 64 for me there was no stepping back Forward get it dealt with. A life in the Army may have helped. All I can say is I had all this done in Grrmany so if I trusted a Germam Urologist I would think your task is easy TRUST your doctor or find another. By yhe way mine was fantastic and its true 4 door techneak really does work! Good these Germans. Well I wish you lots of luck and my advice is go and get it sorted NOW Best of luck Ian G'day TerryW and welcome to the world of indecisiveness... By the sounds of things you have done a pretty good job of convincing yourself NOT to have a biopsy... From a personal viewpoint I have been one of those that has had a biopsy done...it was a quick painless and simple procedure after which I drove myself home and had absolutely NO effects from it whatsoever... :-) Unfortunately I am also one of the so-called 3% that has an aggressive tumor... I truly hope that this is not the situation with you or anyone as I know what's ahead for me...:-( I am a big believer in everyone's right to choices however Prostate Cancer is not something I would ever take lightly... Good luck with you decision making but just remember one thing - I'm now and always a couple of steps behind my cancer and will never catch it...time is an extremely important factor... Hi Terri, this is such a difficult call. Without the Gleason score you cannot assess the competing risks. Without a biopsy you cannot get the Gleason score. I don't think you have had an MRI scan. I am firmly in favour of an MRI scan as part of the information feeding into the decision about a biopsy. Yes, well ... take a look at David 41094 's posts. From their optimistic beginnings, to the ongoing reality check ! Also if you think you are tough enough take a stroll through your local Hospital's Rad/Oncology suite, have a look at the pallor and resigned despair of the Patients, the tubes etc., and then speak to one or two people about dying from terminal Prostate Cancer. Yes, your Consultant does think you are wasting his time because he lives with the disease, trying to preserve both life and it's quality. Yours in fact. And you are a 'Johnny come lately ' trying to intellectualise your way through a maze of statistics, thinking that you will dodge a bullet. Well, you may ...but even so in that event, no-one else can benefit from your good fortune and so you can't really contribute very much to a site like this where many participants are fighting for their lives. Incidentally I assume that at the moment, you are pain-free ? In the meantime, please do us all a favour on this site and don't persist with your hypothetical. Thanks and Regards, Dudley  I entirely agree with your approach. Biopsies are invasive and generally painful. 6 percent of people will require hospitalisation as a result of sepsis and one in a thousand people will die as a direct result of the biopsy. I would recommend a scan which will provide at least as much useful information. Only then would I consider a TARGETED biopsy. The prostate is the only part of the body which is routinely biopsies without prior imaging - madness in my opinion, especially given that it is typically trans-rectal. I would read 'Prostate cancer breakthroughs' by Jay Cohen MD which gives a step-by-step approach to diagnosis and treatment. I wish you well. It seems likely that posts on PCa and an acceptance of and concurrence with Professional Medical Advice ; as opposed to individual interpretations of statistics and deferrment of treatment, will continue on this Site and so it may be helpful to try and clear away some of the fog of generalization : It is acknowledged and accepted within the Medical Profession that unilaterally there are no empirical studies on PSA/Biopsy/ infection rates/ treatment/mortality et al. And this lack of uniformity produces unclear Clinical Data. Currently for example, statistics on infection do not necessarily show the age bracket, ethnic origins, or underlying health status of the Patient, nor what the biopsy's resultant Gleason score was for that Patient. Just as an example, in my case I was given to understand that as my underlying general health status is pretty good then even though I'm in my early seventies, I would not be at contra- indicatory procedural risk. And so it was. But hypothetically if I were say in my late seventies/early eighties and had diabetes and a cardiac condition and therefore had an impaired immune system, then I might easily have sustained an infection/death. And that's not to say that even with that underlying scenario I didn't need the urgent Prostate assessment, seeing as how I'd been ignoring impaired flow for a long time and now presented with no-flow urinary symptoms, suspected to be caused by a Prostate tumor. What seems to me as being most relevant in choosing a way forward, is the Provisional Diagnosis, Opinion and Recommendation of your Consultant. He/She will have assessed you, your current general health status, your medical and Family history, your test results and your symptoms if any. Based on years of Training, Continuous Study, Practical Experience and Peer Review Consultations, the most expedient and beneficial course of treatment will be recommended for you. Those initial consultations when they are focusing intensely on you Terry, are vital. And if they thought you were at increased risk of infection, they would definitely appraise you of that. Having been through the process and during that from what I was given to understand generally, your particular type of PSA velocity creep is pretty much indicative that you have a PCa issue to address or at the very least, illiminate. What you don't want, is for slow-growing PCa to turn aggressive on you. And it can and does. And you DEFINITELY don't want to die of an un-treated PCa. that you could have completely knocked off inside 6-12 months, were it not for the confusing muddle of inconclusive statistics you are wading through. To conclude, I quote you : ' ... and at my age quality of life is more important than lifespan '. Well, I'm sorry to tell you that if what may well have been a slow-growing PCa is turning aggressive on you, you will not have a quality of life,r a life-span.  Terry I read with great interest your posting and the very first thing that struck me and that George and another has pointed out is the issue of an MRI Scan. Another key fact that you mention is that you have an Enlarged Prostate. A major problem in the NHS at many of their hospitals is this insistence that they Biopsy before they do an MRI Scan. If you attend any of the major specialist centres or if you speak with leading Urologists around the UK you will find that they all recommend an MRI before biopsy. In addition to the MRI many places also offer the PCA3 Urine test. A combination of both of these non invasive tests can put your mind at ease on the risk of you having Prostate Cancer and subsequently requiring a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis. A major problem with biopsies taken before MRI's is that even if a positive result is found you will still need that MRI scan to determine the extent of the cancer. The trauma of the biopsy often means you have to wait several months for the prostate to settle down to enable a more clear scan to be taken, often leading to more anxiety. For you peace of mind, I would recommend seeing if you can get an \"Enhanced MRI\" and a PCA3 test. Neither of these tests were available to me in 2012 when I had my surgery. I just had the standard MRI after my biopsy. My surgeon/urologist told me that he would have preferred me to have had the scan before the biopsy. Due to the trauma of the biopsy my scan only showed cancer on the right of my prostate. When it was removed there was considerably more cancer on the left and the apex - this wasnt seen on the scan due to the biopsy. So get a Scan first and then sit with your consultant and decide upon next steps after that. Also, try not to worry. You say you ahev an enlarged prostate. I am assuming you are on medication to reduce that? You wouldnt do anything until your prostate has reduced in size anyway. Are they giving you an MRI for your Enlarged Prostate or are you just relying on an ultrasound? I would highly recommend that if you are worried you give the help line at Prostate Cancer UK a call. The clinical nurses who man that service are excellant and can answer any worries you might have. Best regards Eddie"

          "Introduction I\u2019m 70 and have a PSA which was at 4.6 when I was 66, and while it has been regularly monitored over the past 18 months or so has been moving up and down between 6 and 7. My doctor thought that I should be referred and I have had two hpital appointments, but I have so far decided against having a prostate biopsy, though it is obvious that my local hospital\u2019s oncology department would like me to have one. The health worker I saw at my first hospital appointment was happy to discuss the issue with me, but I suspect the consultant I just saw probably thought I should stop wasting his time and get booked in for a biopsy without further delay. I have received information from those two appointments, but I have obtained much more information from online research. Based on studying a number of online medical reports over the period 2008 \u2013 2014, it is evident that there is increasing prejudice, at least in the US and Australia, against the use of prostate biopsies. The primary reasons for this seem to be an increasing risk of serious infections from the most common type of biopsy, a growing recognition (though this may be controversial) that psa screening and biopsies are ineffective in reducing the incidence of terminal prostate cancer, and that screening and biopsies contribute to massive \u2018over treatment\u2019 of prostate cancers Summary of Statistics (some of which may be controversial but all of which are based on (my interpretation of) studies published in urological journals, research reviews and conference speeches by leading urologists). Of every 100 men who have a prostate biopsy: \u00b7 97 didn\u2019t need it (that is, they don\u2019t have a prostate cancer requiring treatment) \u00b7 6 will get a serious infection as a result (a figure which has doubled in recent years), which will cause them to be hospitalised, and from which a very occasional man will die, while others (we don\u2019t know how many) will have persistent painful side effects \u00b7 between 17 and 22 will be offered treatment that they don\u2019t need, as a result of which about 25% of men in their 70s will become incontinent or impotent. The Perceived Indicators for Biopsy Primarily a raised psa; a psa which has increased rapidly over a fairly short period, typically a year; smoking; family history of prostate cancer; age (considered with the other factors). I have a raised psa, but it\u2019s not dramatically high \u2013 it\u2019s been between 6 and 7 over the past 1 \u00bd years, and it has not increased dramatically \u2013 it was 4.6 five years ago. I do smoke, and I am 70, but I am generally in good health, and there is no history of prostate cancer in my family that I know of. Statistics Based on Recent Urological Papers Of every 100 men who have a biopsy, between 75 and 80 have no cancerous cells and didn\u2019t need the procedure; 20 to 25 will have cancerous cells found on biopsy BUT a large percentage of these men will have a tumour which develops very slowly, will not be terminal and doesn\u2019t really need any treatment. Only a small percentage will have an aggressive tumour requiring immediate intervention; the Harvard School of Public Health, in a 2014 paper, put this percentage at 10 \u2013 15%, or 3 men out of the 100. This means only 3 out of every 100 men who have a biopsy really needed it. And there are two other real concerns. 1. The one certainty with prostate biopsies is that 100% of the men who have them will have \u2018side effects\u2019. Some will be shortlived and not really a problem, but some will be painful and longer lasting, and some men, currently about 6 out of the 100, will be hospitalised with serious infections, and the very occasional one will die. There are no statistics for the number of men receiving treatment for post-biopsy infections at doctors\u2019 surgeries. I don\u2019t necessarily see this as a reason not to have a biopsy, because obviously if you really need a biopsy to diagnose a terminal cancer then it\u2019s worth putting up with the side effects. But do you really need it? 2. Most worryingly, doctors apparently can\u2019t tell from the biopsy result whether cancerous cells denote an aggressive tumour which requires immediate treatment, or a slow developing tumour which probably does not need any treatment. As a result, as I understand it, all patients with cancerous cells may generally be assumed to need immediate treatment, such as hormone replacement, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, even though 85-90% of them don\u2019t need any treatment. Research papers suggest that in men in their 70s, 25% who have this treatment will become incontinent or impotent as a result. Many of these men will suffer these consequences despite the fact that they didn\u2019t ever need the treatment they were subjected to. It\u2019s also worrying that at two hospital appointments the issue of what happens after the biopsy has not been raised, even though it was clear that both the people I saw thought I should have a biopsy. Maybe they would say that it would have been raised if and when I agreed to a biopsy, but given concerns about receiving unnecessary treatment, I feel it should have been raised at the time the issue of having a biopsy was raised. Would they have explained to me that if cancerous cells were found, they might not be able to tell whether I needed treatment or not? Would they have told me that there was a risk (if not a certainty?) that I would be \u2018offered\u2019 treatment that I might not need? Since they did not have that conversation with me I cannot answer those questions. Conclusions My psa is raised but not highly raised and it didn\u2019t move up fast, so I feel it is not at present a firm indicator of the need for a prostate biopsy \u2013 it\u2019s inconclusive. The only additional risk factor I have is that I smoke, and I suspect that is often overplayed by the NHS. According to NHS statistics, I should be suffering the ill effects of smoking by the age of 70, in the form of early signs of lung cancer, but when I had a chest scan a year ago it was clear. In addition I have an enlarged prostate \u2013 which was determined at my first hospital visit not to feel cancerous \u2013 which means I would have a heightened psa anyway. I have been offered another appointment by the hospital in six months, and I am going to take that up, but unless things change I think that has to be the last for the moment. It\u2019s pointless me trooping up to the hospital every six months when I don\u2019t want a biopsy \u2013 which is all they can do by way of diagnosis \u2013 and there could be people with aggressive tumours urgently needing those appointments. So I need to decide over the next six months finally, whether I am going to have a biopsy or not. The hospital has asked me to have another psa blood test before I go for the 6 month appointment, but I have asked my GP for three-monthly psa tests, so that I can get more of a feel for movement on the results before I go for the hospital appointment. If my psa is suddenly moving up rapidly over the next six months, then, depending how fast and how far it is moving, I may agree to a biopsy. Otherwise it is unlikely that I will, in which case there is not much point in the hospital continuing to see me \u2013 though I will ask my local surgery to continue monitoring me with 4 or 6-monthly psa tests. At the age of 70 I still work full-time (for myself), and having unnecessary treatment for prostate cancer would certainly have far more of an impact on my life than having a slow developing prostate cancer which would not affect my health or life expectancy, and might even have more of an impact in the short term than having an aggressive prostate tumour. So it\u2019s a numbers game. None of us is going to live forever, and at my age quality of life is more important than lifespan. Younger doctors especially often don\u2019t take account of this, and assume that keeping you breathing, no matter what state you are in, is some sort of medical triumph. Not surprisingly, there are lots of older people who don\u2019t see it that way!"

          " Hi Ana, sorry to hear you are feeling this way but you are definately not crazy. This is what anxiety and depression does to you, changing the way you think to extremes. I hate to say that I know how you feel because the way you are feeling now you are probably thinking that nobody can possibly understand you, but this is exactly how I have felt before. It took a lot of effort for me to believe that I wasn't going crazy and to convince me that I was unwell and to encourage to talk to a doctor and get help. It is great that you have been to your GP about this, well done :). How long have you been receiving counselling? If it has not been that long then stick with it, it may still work for you. However, if you know that it definately isn't working for you then go back to your GP and tell them this, because counselling isn't right for everyone and there may be something else that could help you. Are you taking any medication? Please go back to see your GP and tell them that you are not happy with how the counselling is going, maybe write down everything you have written down so they can understand how you are feeling, this is what I do at my appointments because when I'm in the appointment I get nervous and forget to say all the things that I wanted to say. Do not worry, you are not wasting anyone's time, there are lots of people who want to help you :).  Thank you for your response itsofluffy. It's reassuring to hear that I'm not the only one who has felt lost this way, I've been anxious my whole adult life and have always felt as though I'm weird and defective and never really addressed it but this is my first experience where it's a constant presence stopping me from functioning and feeling this way is very scary and overwhelming. I feel stupid for even feeling this way and taking up people's time. I've had counseling for a month but I actually feel worse than I did before I started, I'm not on medication as I've said I only consider it as a last resort before, I'll go back to my doctor, I too always make light of my problems when I'm there and find it hard to say how I'm really feeling. Thanks for the encouragement and for taking the time to reply. Hello Ana, I am in exactly the same situation! I have cut off from all my friends and find that I make excuses if anyone asks me to go out with them shopping or for coffee because I fear that I will be lost for words or make the situation awkward. I constantly overthink things which makes my anxiety a lot worse. I have tried self help books over the years and nothing seems to help. I was prescribed medication 3 days ago (Citalopram 10mg which is for depression and anxiety) I got to the stage where I was so low that everything feels pointless and I dont enjoy anything I do and so medication was my last resort. I am hoping the antidepressants help because I really cannot live like this, I feel like I am wasting my life. I am 24. I hope you speak with your doctor and get the help you need, if you need to talk I am here. Ruby Sorry, I would just like to add that prior to being prescribed medication I had blood tests for annemia, underactive thyroid, overactive thyroid and diabetes as these conditions can cause low mood and lack of energy or motivation. My results came back clear which is why I was then prescribed Citalopram. Ruby No problem Ana :). I am no expert on any of this but I know that any support from others and hearing the experiences of others helps me, so I am glad I have been able to reassure you. I have never suffered from depression or serious anxiety before so all of this is new to me, but at the moment I think I am doing ok. I just take one day at a time, some days can be good and others bad, but I have learnt not to expect to be better overnight and I think it takes a lot of effort to push yourself to do what it takes to get better. I understand how you feel about only wanting to take medication as a last resort, I was like that too. Then my depression and anxiety rapidly worsened to a point where I was in desperate need of help. I started citalopram in November, but my GP has changed me to Mirtazepine this week because I was still having problems with insomnia. I agree that you should only take medication if you really need it, which unfortunately some of us do. When I think back to how I was in November I do think that I have improved, although I can't be certain this is due to the anti-depressants. I hope you can start to feel better soon too. I am still waiting to receive any sort of counselling, I do have quite negative views about it working for me but I think I am still going to give it a go, I hope it helps. Good luck when you go back to see your GP :). Hi Ana, I know you posted this a few months ago so I hope that everything is feeling a bit better now. I just wanted to say thank you for posting this. I feel exactly the same way, that everything I say is wrong, so reading your blog made me feel less alone. I'm also in a high pressure industry and now work from home - which makes everything worse because I can't see anyone to check that they're not really offended or angry at me. In fact even writing this is scary, as I really don't want to say the wrong thing. When I went to see my GP, they first recommended me for counselling (which let me talk but didn't help much). Then they recommended me a course of Cognative Behavioural Therapy which turned out to be really useful. It helped me start to realise that the way I feel isn't my fault and that it's an illness, rather than I'm intrinsicly a bad person. It meant that I didn't have to take medication (I agree that I only want that as a last resort!), because it gave me practical ways to deal with things. If you want a taste of what it's like then look here http://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/resources/infopax.cfm?Info_ID=46 But the thing that really helped was working through exercises like that with a professional - the exercises seem easy but they're really not. You have to fully commit to them before they work It wasn't perfect and I still have bad days (today might be one), especially now I'm living abroad where CBT isn't available. But I thought it might give you another option if you were still feeling bad and let me get the fact that I'm still feeling anxious off my chest! Shallan  Hi Ana. Never did this before., but HAD to to let u know you are so not alone . Having very similar feelings lately wife is divorcing me., live in her home town, and everyone has turned their back on me. I'm an artist , and haven't always \" tried \" to nurture friendships, ie, was somewhat comfy most of time alone. But always liked to know someone who cared was close by. Been consed with anxiety and stress of feeling going through this by myself. A sense of being paralyzed, and without hope for the unknown future . The worst of what you're feelin and goin through, is feeling you're not wanted needed desired and worthy. It's not true and your mind will play tricks on you, and perpetuate the aloneness . Take heart. You are not alone. I am, we are out here going through similar experiences. We should rally, gather, and show each other that WE are not going through this alone, and our stress and despair is not true, not reality. Be it truth, Ana, you have people like \" you\"., who care!!!!  Honestly you are not going crazy I've been feeling the exact same thing sinceI I was a child i'm just happy now that I found this page and theres someone who's feeling the same thing, its all part of depression and anxiety, if someone looks at me wierd or says something I get anxious and think about it when im in bed at night and I start crying, anxiety pains the lot, it is horrible but knowing theres other people thats going through the same thing makes me fee. Better because if they new the. Would understand, I've had people saying to me I'm over reacting, attention seeking and that but they obv don't understand at all which makes it even harder to cope with but I guess counciling and talking to people with simularities make it easier xx Ana I just read this, I've felt this way before, I cant imagine how hard it must be to live like that all the time! Mt heart goes out to you, I really hope you're feeling better. You may have skizoaffective, which causes people to have false thoughts/ideas/beliefs about themselves and/or others. I know because i have it. Its very scary and there is treatment for it. Will you tell me how you have been? Im really concerned now even though I don't know you. with love, cameron."

          "I've never posted anything like this before. I'm 29 and I work in a high-pressure, insular industry. For about 6 months now my self confidence has deteriorated to the point where I ruminate every single moment of the day about how I am perceived by others. Every time I make a mistake I want to cry, I feel embarrassed and ashamed of myself all day long, like I can't get anything right and like I'm a total waste of space. I've lost almost all my friends, (not through lack of trying - I'm always the last one to reach out) which I'm pretty sure is because I'm so nervous, awkward and always say the wrong thing. I can't get through one day without doing something stupid and kicking myself over it later, everyone around me seems so smart and together and they must think I'm such a mess. The people I have left I'm worried will see how I'm changing, and won't be around much longer. I try and push myself to go out but I'd really rather just be alone so nobody can judge me. I can't see an end to this feeling, I used to always be myself and screw the consequences, I had friends and I was sure that I was a good person with a bright future but now I care so much what's being thought of me I don't know who I am anymore. I feel like I can't be inside my own was anymore, especially as I hate my stupid self so much. I want to be successful but I can't get past this weirdness that puts everyone off. And it's not just myself I feel this way about, I can't help but think negatively about everyone. I'm pretty sure my mind is playing tricks on me, but part of me thinks maybe I'm finally seeing myself and everything the way it really is. I'm confused and my mind doesn't stop. I've been to the doctor and I'm having counselling but it's not helping at all. What should I do? Am I going crazy? I really worry that I'm going to lose myself completely! I don want to waste anyone's time but I had to get some of this out of my head."

You should consider taking oral fluconazole (Diflucan) combined with using a hydrocortisone cream or Fugacil cream, which may take one to two weeks for healing. Avoid having sex until the infection is fully healed. Practice good hygiene. Always keep your penis and genitals clean and dry. Eat natural yogurt or consume probiotic supplements for relief.  Hi, have I not responded to you on this issue that you have posted elsewhere on this site? The term Balanitis is a generic term for redness and irritation at the end of the penis. From your experience with Doctors it sounds like you are wasting your time going back to them. Your best hope is that Urology will find the solution for you. You could have one of several things actually causing this - keep to washing the head of your penis with water only. When taking a shower draw your foreskin as far forward as you can to protect the head / glans of penis, then when you have fully rinsed everything off, expose the head of your penis and rub with the inside of your hand. Washing is the first part - you must then 100% dry your entire penis immediately after washing it - always do this first, then elsewhere on your body after a shower. Do not apply anything such as a Lube, Skin Cream / Lotion - in short, anything that is chemical based. The Loprox is an antifungal - you may need to move to a Steroidal ointment, such as Clobetasol, at least until you start getting positive results .... you need to work with a urologist until you find a solution to what you have  HI .. i am interested in this as a male friend has similar looking. Forget abt the creams (esp cortisone) as (in his case at least) any type of cream causes instant irritaion etc. May i ask - does it \"get better\" if left to dry and does the redness and inflammation settle down if there is no activity? Approx how long this going on and was there any previous history of hydrocortisone / antifungal or topical anti viral or anti bacterial as suspicion these \"trigger the inflammation\" Jenny hi. i have the same problem too. ive been to the men specialist several times and prescribed me with antibiotics and cream. i went urologist too. urologist mentioned that my penis skin is too thick and need to cut the skin. i refused it. any idea what is it? men specialist said yeast infections but the urologist said its due of too long penis skin. *Jack. how is yours doing? any good progress? bumping this up, 5 weeks later its still here..."

          "This all began when it started to burn while I urinated. I went to the doctors because I thought it was a UTI, but the test came back negative. Got tested for STD's, the tests also came back negative. Ok no big deal, I thought. Maybe this will go away on its own. I then started developing a rash on the tip of the penis and along the base that burned post urination and during ejaculation. I did some research online and thought it was probably a yeast infection. Bought some Canesten and tried applying it twice a day for a week. I also took the pill (Fluconazole). This resulted in no change in the symptoms. Went back to the doc, who then prescribed Fucidin H cream (Hydrocortisone 1% Fusidic Acid 2%). I rubbed it on twice a day for a week, no change. Went to a Urologist who did an examination (but no further tests) and told me I could get circumcised, but apart from that offered no further solutions. Told me it could be prostatitis. I then went to a Dermatologist, who looked at it and prescribed me Loprox anti-fungal cream with hydrocortisone (1%) told me to use it twice daily on the area for one month. I then switched to just Loprox because it appeared as though hydrocortisone was making the irritation worse. The Dermatologist told me to go see the urologist again if symptons don't improve. I'm still applying Loprox two weeks into treatment, and the changes are minimal if any. The rash goes down at the tip and expands at the base, almost triangular in shape. There are small scales (or maybe cracks) in the skin, and the area is red, almost as if inflamed. I have no discharge from the penis. Any kind of friction (i.e. masturbation) makes the redness and burning much, much worse. I have been abstaining from that for now and only washing the area with warm water. I have thrown out all my heavily scented soaps. I am in the process of attempting to get an appointment with another urologist in order to get a second opinion. Topical creams don't seem to be doing much, but I am going to keep putting Loprox on it for now. I feel like the Docs have been kind of brushing me off/don't want or don't know how to deal with balanitis. Nothing I am really doing is working, so I'm wondering if anyone else has any solutions.

          " Thank you. I came to the same conclusion after some research . This site helped immensley in my search for a non invasive procedure with tth least sideffects. Thank you Bill. That is the best summation of treatment options available for BPH that I have ever seen, My own reasoning when deciding which option to choose was to go with the best option first which was PAE. If it didn't work I could try the others. As it turns out my PAE was extremely successful.  Please give me advice on choices in Chicago. I agree with what you said; alot of doctors just look at the body as a way to save money. I had a good result, so far, from TURP for which the stats are good. I have nothing against up and coming treatments though such as PAE. All treatments can have negative outcomes though TURP, PAE and many others. The most important thing is to find a good surgeon who is very experienced in the procedure to be done whether it is TURP or PAE. The other thing that helped me make a decision was to look at the objective stats that governments use to assess treatment outcomes. In my case TURP. Reading forums will only get you a collection of stories, some good, some bad. PAE has risks too as the prostate dies, the dying tissue can cause issues so nothing is ever perfect. No treatment ever is. The prostate is very complex and the issues vary from person to person. Some patients here on the forum have complicated medical histories and problems and it makes sad reading. Luo61644 said it right. The prostate has many arteries. Reducing flow to the right one is an art and science. For Chicago, the only Top 50 IR I believe is Steve Smith. Just type his name and PAE and you will find him and a lot on PAE.The other pro is Bob Vogelzang. Both these guys have made many many breakthroughs in the field of IR. Sometime I'd like to publish a list of everything the pros in this profession do, you will be very surprised and enlightened. There are other guys in Chicago who work for these guys too. I would have to agree. I am 47 and I have so much pain. I can hardly urinate, but I don't want to go in because of what it may mean to my sex life or lack there of if I do a proceedure like TURP. My dad had TURP and though he doesn't talk about it I know that it ruined his sex life. Why must we trade that for relief from symptoms. I have finally had enough and I am seeing my doctor friday. really scared. I don't want to be screened for prostate cancer. I believe I have Prostititus if so then hopefully antibiotics will help. If it is BPH then I am in real trouble. Getting that at my age means bad things for me as I age. My dad had BPH really bad, so it makes since that I would have it as well. On a positive note at least no man in my imediate family has had prostate cancer. This means at least I am low risk. This is why I do not wish to be screened. I hate the urologist, what a modern day medical mangler they are. How does one find a doctor who has personally had BPH? I am sure that such a doctor has done more research on the subject for his own well being, Doctors do not discuss their own medical problems with their patients and so we have to hope that they are giving us their best professional advice. For Craig84609: Verify with a Urologist you do not have cancer and ask what he or she recommends, then get to a good IR for a 2nd opinion. Chicago has them. Other major cities probably do too. But also check to determine the size of your prostate. I had prostatitis, but I also had a very enlarged prostate. Some people have small prostates with prostatitis. Others have small prostates but the lobes or whatever are shaped or positioned such that some people are more susceptible. Regardless of whether you come to Chicago for help, search \"VIR Chicago\" and you can read up on Dr Steven Smith. He is a really advanced IR. The procedure is new to the US so do not expect to see a lot of stuff online in the US yet. I would get a consultation from him via phone to start. Or try another IR in a major US city. I am led to believe the downside risks are negligible and the procedure is non-invasive. A great fallback procedure would be HoLEP, and it worked great for me, but it cores out your prostate, and along with it can go your libido and possibly cause retrograde ejaculation. If you want to seriously consider HoLEP, the godfather of it is Jim Lingeman in Indi. He did my procedure. But I definitely would try PAE from an IR first given the chance to d it al over again. Good luck!"

          "(for enlarged prostate) Hi everyone, Many of you have good and bad experiences. And many are reading these blog sites to try to figure out the best option to address enlarged prostate. I have a fair amount of experience in the matter: 1) I went to 5 different Urologists for help 2) I tried FlowMax (I called it \"FloMin\"!) 3) I had Greenlight - A waste to try for larger prostates 4) I had TURP - It provided less than 12 months reprieve 5) I had HoLEP - It has worked great, though I now have retrograde ejaculation and probably lower testosterone 6) I know a fair amount about PAE (Prostate Artery Embolization) because I have many IR (Interventional Radiology) Doctor friends. The point of this note is to help out you all realize the following: 1) PAE may be by far the best procedure for enlarged prostates. Why? Because it is non-invasive, it does not gouge out portions of your body, it probably is the best at helping you keep your testosterone/libido high, you can go back in if necessary and do it again, and if you decide later it was not as effective and you want to try TURP or something else you can. 2) You are wasting your time asking Urologists about PAE because none of them do PAE, it is a different type of procedure only done by IR's. 3) You are worth money to doctors, so expect very biased advice. They will only recommend procedures they are trained to do so they can make money off of your body. For example, I went to 4 Urologists who never once mentioned HoLEP as an option. When I found out about HoLEP through online forum sites I asked 3 of these Urologists what they thought of the procedure. All 3 said it was risky and not worth doing!! Most of them really tried to sell me on a 2nd TURP procedure. The bottom line is these doctors do not want to retool because it takes time and time is money, and there are too many of you patients out there who are not going to question the advice of your Urologist! PAE is becoming mainstream in Europe and Australia and has started to be successful in the US. There are several very experienced IR doctors who can help you. I suggest you all just search \"PAE (and major city name)\" and see what comes up. Chicago is becoming a hotbed of experience for this non-invasive procedure. Just look for \"top IR doctors (and a major city)\" and see what comes up. I can help you find great ones in Chicago. I am not upset I had HoLEP because it really helped me. But I wish I knew about it early on and had tried it. I am pretty sure it would have solved my problems and helped my manly functions work optimally. Lastly, if some of you are on anti coagulants,that may be another good reason to consider PAE, since it is non-invasive. Remember, Urologists are not going to recommend PAE and many will not recommend HoLEP. It is up to you to do your homework!"

          " Hi there, No your not alone, I understand where your coming from. Has anything specific happened to drive these feelings? Have you thought about councelling? Im on my second session and im finding it really useful. X Hello Kaykay, Thank you for taking time to read my post. I cant remember anything specifically happening in my life to trigger these feelings they just sort of developed from nowhere and have worsened over time. I have been unemployed for half a year and my last job was only part time and lasted apporoximately 4 months before I decided it wasnt for me. I really want to get a job and be successful but these feelings hold me back, I feel like I am not good enough or capable or smart enough for a real job. I would love to be more independent and earn my own momey but I am stuck in such a dark deep place I just cant even imagine finding a job or starting work. I have no social life which I dont feel sad about because I dont enjoy drinking alcohol (that seems to be what anyone I know wants to do) I am currently in college but the course I am doing is very basic (it gets me out of the house though I suppose). I have not had any therapy and my doctor did suggest I make an appointment for councelling (which I have not yet done) I dont know why, but just the thought of councelling scares me, sitting and talking with someone scares me a lot, I actually dont think I could do it and I know that if I make an appointment I will have sleepless nights leading up to the appointment and panicking over it (Stupid I know). I have actually walked out of the doctors waiting room before and stood outside the building and called the receptionist from my mobile phone to tell her that I was feeling unwell and had to leave because I was rehearsing in my head what I should say to the doctor and it all got too much for me. I really dont know why I feel like this, I used to be more outgoing and not anxious. I couldnt even enjoy a drink at Christmas with my own mum because of this anxious feeling and low mood. Ruby  Can I also add, I decided the job was not for me as it was caring for a disabled person overnight and I was suffering from depression at the time and I was not in a fit state of mind to carry on with this type of work. Ruby I posted recently called what should i do for the best, perhaps have a read and maybe it wont make you feel so alone? The help is out there if you want it, maybe going to the gp and asking for some We need your would help? I suffered over christmas period too and the things i used to enjoy became dull and made me feel worthless. Your not alone Kate. X Thank you Kate, I will have a look at your post now. Hopefully we will get through this and life will be brighter. Ruby x Hi Ruby Yes I know how it feels to think everything in life is pointless. Depression makes you lose interest in everything that you once enjoyed. This can be anything from going out with your friends, eating foods that you enjoy eating, doing hobbies that you used to enjoy or anything that would usually bring you enjoyment. It can make you want to mope about at home or stay in bed all day. When I first saw my doctor about depression he asked me when was the last time I felt happy, and I couldn't think of anything, depression makes it difficult to be positive about anything, which is why you have all these questions about what's the point of all these things in life. I am progressing in recovery with medication, I hope you start to feel better soon. I only joined this site recently too and it helps to talk to others going through the same thing. It is good to find someone that you can share you concerns with, I'm happy to help if I can :). Hi Ruby, I often feel the same way as you. I have been out of work for 7 months now (6 months because I was off sick with depression and the last month unemployed because of the pressure they were placing me under to go back). I often wonder why I even bother to get out of bed and what the point is to life. Why do people just go to work, come home, go to bed and do it all over again. Where is the pleasure in anything. I sit in the house all day every day on my own with nothing to do and even when the weather is nice and I could go for a walk or see my mum or a friend, I often don't have the motivation to do it, however I still stay home and say how bored I am and wish I could go out and live a normal life. I've found it's amazing how much a job can give you a sense of purpose. But I feel the same as you and don't have the confidence and don't feel like i'm capable of doing anything, even the simplest of tasks. I wish I could offer you advice to help you but the only thing I can recommend is try counselling as I have found it very useful in the past, and also try and stick with the college course as it will give you something to get up for and give you a sense of achievement  Hi Becca, Im so sorry to hear that you are in the same situation as I am :( it is really not a nice place to be. I suppose the fact that we have acknowledged there is something not right and are getting help (even just by discussing it on these forums) shows that we are able to take control of our lives. You are very right about how a job can give someone a purpose in life and a reason to get out of bed in the morning, I just find it so difficult to see any point in it all and when I try to picture myself in a job I feel that I will struggle and fail. I managed to go for a walk today to my local park with my mum but as soon as I came home I spent the rest of the day upstairs basically doing nothing... I have work to do for college but I just cant bring myself to do it. I put everything off until the very last minute! I just feel so lazy and useless, I look around me and people I know seem to have their lives planned and are moving forward and I am just stuck, waiting for something to happen? I suppose. Do you have any hobbies or things you still enjoy doing? What have you lost interest in? And how old are you? (If you dont mind me asking) I am 24. Thank you for posting a comment, its really good being able to talk to others in the same boat. Ruby X i genuinely wish to help you, and i hope what i say will not sound outlandish or strange, i say it because i so strongly believe in it that it surpasses my fear of online scrutiny from others. i read through many forums on depression, and i enjoy seeing the changes people while i try to help as much as possible. let me give it to you in straightforward terms. Humans have been roaming the earth for thousands of millennia, roughly 6 thousand thousand years since divergence from primate-like ancient ancestors. for the duration of that enormous amount of time, humans became extremely adept at survival. one of the main modes of transportation and survival that we used to obtain food and achieve safety was through long distance travel. we did not have claws nor powerful jaws, nor were we quick. but we were able to lope about at a brisk pace for prolonged periods of time. we have such a vast amount of adaptations reflecting this theory that it would be rather foolish to not accept it. we sweat, lost our body hair (to more efficiently cool ourselves through sweating), move about bi-pedally, and so much more, so that we could efficiently and effectively hunt four legged animals that after several hours of galloping, could not cool down, and would overheat and die. we had no tools nor weapons, only our hands and teeth, and not until around 1.8 MYA were even the first stone tools aka rocks, used to kill anything, the bow was not invented until 40,000 years ago. humans ran, and they ran, and they ran, and they ran some more. Fast forward to modern day, where we sit in offices all day and at most get a few hours of exercise a week, can you see where im heading with this? the clear picture is this: humans are good at some things, and designed for them, and when you depart from that which we have evolved to do for millions of years, you get problems. there are so many details and things you may not understand from what i present, but understand this: You need to exercise, and by exercise, i mean run. and you need to run correctly, the way our human ancestors did it, with little to no shoes whatsoever. if you do this, i can guarantee you that your depression will go away. your brain releases a marvelous concoction of chemicals that are an adaptive trait humans evolved to help them cope with the long and painful bouts of exercise. you may have heard of them, they are called endorphins. they are chemically identical with opiates, IE: heroin, morphine, euphoria-inducing drugs. the drugs mentioned above are found in nature from the poppy plant, but are naturally produced in your brain to alleive depression, pain, hunger, anxiety, sadness, and have such a profound impact on the psyche that you may wonder why you've never tried this before! the \"runners high\", is what you get, the bath of well-being inducing chemicals that bathe your brain every time you exercise for prolonged periods of time(an hour or so at least). people who run regularly and eat normal food (food that humans were eating for the last several million years) are much happier and healthier and upbeat and NEVER, NEVER have i met a person who runs long distance regularly and adheres to this lifestyle who has depression. it just doesnt happen, because they stick to what they are designed to do. you dont buy a car and let it sit in your garage so that you can play with its lights, or open its doors, or inflate and deflate its tires, you buy it so that you can drive it. i want you to go and buy a pair of minimalist shoes, that allow your foot to function the way its evolved to function, not thick heeled shoes that cause injuries. your feet are not born weak or broken, they are an evolutionary marvel that da vinci himself wondered at in awe. large shoe companies make lots of money on the false idea that your foot is broken and you need man made devices that have been invented barely 30 years ago for them to work correctly. i want you to go out and jog an easy mile. then wait a few days. when youre not sore, go jog another, then after a week go jog a mile and a half. EASE INTO IT! your feet are weak and soft from wearing shoes your whole life.it will take several months. before long, you will be running like homo erectus, and loving life. do it for yourself, do it for your life. -will Hi Ruby, I sent you a private message in response to your post above Becca Hello, I read it your problem than i think you spend your all time in inside the home.I suggest you do some job,creative work and engage yourself with some activities .You do regularly in your routine 30 min yoga is must for you and also you do jogging ,aerobic and some exercise. you listen soft music and You can take consulling.I hope it will help you . if you think positive than you feel life is the most beautiful thing of the world so don't think negative. Be Positive. Take care Dr. Girivar  Dear Ruby, I bumped into this forum when I searched for \"I feel like life is pointless\". I read your entire note and I can relate to it. You mentioned that there has been nothing in your life that has triggered this feeling. Actually I am quite sure it is the contraceptive. (Try not taking it for a month and see the difference). I went through the same feelings, anxiety, shortness of breath, restlessness, panic, later this lead to feelings of depression after a month (I am still working on being positive and coming out of it). I had taken Novelon just for a month and I underwent these mad feelings. I thought I was going crazy and losing my mind. When I first felt anxiety I saw a doctor. The doc asked me to check for thyroid and the test was negative, I insisted it's the mind and saw a psychiatrist he was wondering too, that I sound perfectly sane but was feeling unlike myself all of a sudden, he prescribed something for anxiety. I was scared I will be dependenton those pills forever. while leaving the shrink, he asked me if I was getting my periods regularly, that's when I mentioned it got delayed by about 8 days and hence I am on OCP to correct it. He was surprised and said that my symptoms were not so common side effect of OCPs, but if a doctor has prescribed them to you, you can continue. Believe me that shrink was god sent! The first thing I did when I got home was search for posts of women facing these issues online and that opened my eyes and life felt better suddenly. You would be surprised to see how many women feel anxiety and depression on taking OCPs-I am talking about women facing full blown panic attacks. I cursed that drug and trashed it and swore never to take it again, and let everybody I know about my experience. I didnt feel anxious after about 2 days, but anxiety begets anxiety so it should take sometime to completely come out of it. Please try staying of the pill and (use other forms of contraceptives instead, not oral) see the difference. Stay positive. Do your regular chores. Talk to positive people. exercise, most importantly eat well (eat sources of Vit B6, B12, folic acid). Eat well because you need serotonin read -(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill). The section on depression says that \"Low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain, have been linked to depression. High levels of estrogen, as in first-generation COCPs, and progestin, as in some progestin-only contraceptives, have been shown to promote the lowering of brain serotonin levels by increasing the concentration of a brain enzyme that reduces serotonin. This observation, along with some small research studies[60] have inspired speculation that the pill causes depression.\" Hoping to hear from you if it changed anything. I still have my bouts of feeling low, but I am in a place where I feel I can come out of it completely. I hope you feel better soon. Take care..  I sent you a private message in response to your post above, please read Hey Rubysparks....I hear what you're saying! I totally agree with the chap who said about exercise. It does release endorphines and will give you that feel good factor! Secondly, you need a purpose. You need a reason to be get out of bed in the morning, something that makes you feel alive. I'm reading a great book at the moment called cure for the common life by max lucado. It has a very religious stance to it, but if you're not into that sort of thing, read it anyway!!!!! It talks a lot about finding out what your passions are and how to use them to be fulfilled. Let me know how you get on!"

          "Hello, I am sorry to put such a negative title to this forum post but I feel it is the only way to sum up how I feel. Is anyone else in the same boat as me? I feel like every single thing is pointless and mundane. I question in my mind constantly why people put so much effort and energy into things like making sculptures or painting art or putting their heart and soul into making a scaled village with small handmade green trees etc... I have just randomly chosen those examples but I feel like everything is pointless and I hate feeling this way. I think its really lovely that people enjoy these little things in life and I would love to put my energy into something like those people do but I just cant. I see people around me buying scented candles and ornaments and house decorations and I find myself thinking 'why bother?' And 'what is the point?' I haven't always thought and felt like this, I used to love painting and drawing and being creative but I found that over the years I slowly lost interest to the point were I was forcing myself to try and enjoy those things. I am not organised at all, I look around my room now and there are piles of clothes I have not put away and the room is untidy but I find myself saying ' i will do it tommorow'. I really hate feeling like this and I feel as though I am wasting my life just sitting around everyday and doing nothing but I am finding it so hard to find motivation or energy to actually change my situation. Here is some extra info: I am female I am 24 I have had blood tests for thyroid and diabetes and annemia and they have came back clear I am currently on day 3 of taking Citalopram 10mg (for depression and anxiety) I have tried sertraline a year ago for 2 months and it did nothing. I have felt depressed for nearly 2 years now I have had tinnitus for 2 weeks now but that may be due to a sinus infection and symptoms are slowly going (I have taken antibiotics for 3 days) I have Nexplanon (contraceptive) Thank you for taking the time to read this, I would love to talk to anyone about this situation as I dont really have any friends that I can talk to this about."

          " Hi jesse18393 i will try to give some advise i would go to your Gp if you feel this bad. I have felt like this there is help out there. With depression you need some time to get back on track. It can be daunting to seek help. If your mum doesnt understand speak to a doctor he or she will understand and give you advise on how to get through this. Depression really in my opinion needs to be treated. <p>Hi I agree you need to see a doctor.&#160; As long as you are legally an adult you don&#39;t have to tell anyone your business if you don&#39;t want to and that includes your mother.&#160; It would obviously be better if she could give you some support but it doesn&#39;t always happen with families.&#160; Do you have any other family or friends you can talk to?&#160;&#160; I think counselling would help you.&#160; x</p><p>&#160;</p> tHello Can you explain why you feel the way you do, depression generally is caused by some outside sources, or even family matters.? I understand you were to go and see your GP did He give you medications or any other treatment plans.? You say you are a waste, why do you feel that way ? We we should never do ourselves down, your boyfriends family seem to like you so that should boost your mood, explain what is wrong Jessie you need to move on now if it has been two years since your last relationship ended you need to start again. You have a good family with a boyfriend who seems to think the world of you, most important of all a couple of possible inlaws who seem to liike you as well Sometimes first relationships can become very destructive when they break up and this can be a real problem to move on from My first serious relationship lasted for three years and was destroyed by my family. I did not go out with anyone for upwards of three years and preferred to take variouse courses for work and Partime Youth work, it was a problem although I eventually fought through the negativity and I started slowly to extend my circle of friends. Yes I still thought of my loss, although I had other things to consider until I found someone else that had my interests. You find eventually you will find someone and this person was right, and it is not a good thing to compare your serious partner with those you left behind. It is hoped whn you reach this point you will find someone that is great to be with. You have grieved what you have left and now you celebrate now what you have. Talk to your GP and see what can be done for your negative mood. It is important not to dwell on the past, look forward to the future You have had a hard teacher now you enter life with someone who thinks you are right for him. Do not kick him in the head, enjoy your life and learn together"

          " Hi Dec Your symptoms sound very similar to mine feeling sick all the time never been sick and blood tests, stool sample all came back clear. I also work 12 hour night shift (2 days 2 nights 4 off) so totally understand what your talking about in regards to eating habits. I do still try to eat healthy even on night shifts - while everyone else is eating their KFC or dodgy kebab I'm eating toast or salad roll but it's me feeling rough not them!!! Anyway sorry to hear your not well mate I've got a date for endoscopy so hopefully find out more after that (hopefully not to serious tho) but in the mean time I tried the Lansoprazole which didn't really help I've since been prescribed donperidone and Colofac which I thought helped but I seem to have good days and bad days. Can I ask do you also get pains or bloating feeling? Do you find it's worse first thing in the morning or when your stomach is empty? Doctor thinks I have gastritis but this has been going on for 3 months now!!! I have tried laying off the alcohol almost completely as I did enjoy a beer. Do you drink much alcohol? Smoke? I suggest next step is to also try get booked in for endoscopy to see what's going on inside. I thought could be stomach ulcer but doctor told me at hospital that people don't really get ulcers anymore as it starts off as inflammation (gastritis) and meds normally sort this out before becomes ulcer - not sure how much of that I believe because people are always posting about stomach ulcers. Let me know how you get on mate. Sorry not much help but still going through process of finding out what's wrong with myself. Sometimes it can help just knowing your not alone with these symptoms. All the best Tel.  Hello mate, Thanks so much for replying. Glad I'm not alone, although it's not good that you are having to suffer too. I'm exactly the same on nights - the rest of the shift often get takeaways and I'll be having a pasta or salad sandwich. I answer 999 calls for the ambulance service so it's not a great environment to be in when you're feeling a bit delicate - hearing people vomit down the phone sets me off these days, although it never used to. This makes me wonder if at least part of what is going on with me is psychological, too. Hope your Endoscopy goes successfully. The GP did say at my visit last week that if the symptoms are still there in 2 weeks she will consider sending me for one. My Mum is actually an Endoscopy nurse at the local hospital and both her and her colleagues think I should already have been sent for one instead of wasting time, but I suppose the GP has to treat for the basic stuff first. I too have good and bad days. End of last week was perfect - Thursday and Friday I ate normally and felt wonderful. Thought it was all over. Just spent the weekend away in York and felt rough most of the weekend and even worse now I'm home. Although the GP never advised me to, I felt it was best to cut out alcohol for the time being to see if it made a difference. Can't say I've noticed a difference, so last night I had a couple of pints which was great because it made me really hungry and I was able to eat some food without feeling sick. But I can't be doing that every night just to give myself an appetite! Never smoked either. There is a marked difference between mornings and evenings. Mornings are horrendous (previously I've always been a morning person so I know something is definitely wrong with me!). I have to force myself to eat breakfast and then generally take a Metoclopramide to stop the feeling sick afterwards. I almost feel normal in the evenings, though. GP and my Mum advised that I mustn't allow my stomach to get empty because it will continue to produce acid and if there's no food to deal with then it'll make me feel sick. I understand that, but as I say, even when I do force myself to eat I feel sick. I'm going for some therapy tomorrow to assist with my phobia of sick. I'm sure this is making me feel worse than what is real. Hopefully it will do some good. I'm back in work on Wednesday for 2 day shifts and then 3 nights. Hopefully the busy weekend nights will keep my mind occupied. In answer to your other questions, I do get terrible bloating and abdominal pain but I've suffered with IBS for years so I just put it down to that. How about you? And is there a pattern with yourself? Keep me updated as to how you get on; I'll do likewise. My Mum is at work today and is going to ask the surgeons and consultants she works with for some advice - will post it on here if it's useful! Good to hear from you, All the best, Dec Hi Have either of you lost much weight? Saying this because I have and I am already pretty slim to start with....o worrying...anyway re ulcers I was told the same but I dont understand it wither...I haven't been given antibiotics either for this so bow could it be cured? Anyway I can hardly eat without feeling sick and always have a nagging full strange feeling in stomach..been 9 weeks now ...and I couldn't tolerate the PPI tablets that Dr gave me.....think they were the same as yours.... I have had an endoscopy done, and there was no mass luckily ..consultant thought it could be the gallbladder as it has tones or the pancreas so have an an ultra Sound and CT scan..now awaiting the results....luckily I dint work anymore so that is easier but I have lost a lot of my energy..prob because I have so little to eat... Do go for an endescopy and CT scan..if it is the gall bladder it is easily corrected....... Keep on line  Hi there, good to hear from you. I've not lost much weight - perhaps 6 pounds. Surprising, really, considering how little I am eating compared to previously. Nine weeks is a long time also. Sorry you're having to go through this, too. It's difficult to explain how my stomach feels - it kind of feels full, but still makes the rumbling noises like it's empty. Sounds like you were sent for an endoscopy pretty rapidly - which part of the country are you in, may I ask? I think that's where I'll be headed. If the tablets I'm on we're going to work then they would have done something by now. I fear the Omeprazole is just hiding something else possibly. Ill health eh - what a pain!!! Dec I know what you mean when your saying is it all in my head but they do also say stress plays a big part to these symptoms so becomes a viscous circle. I have also heard about not letting your stomach get to empty as the acid could make it more painful it if is gastritis/somach ulcer but like you say easier said than done when feeling sick all the time. Sounds like you know the perfect people for the job, if your mum does that for a living haha very handy. Yeah let me know what her colleagues suggest. Hi Val, Yes I have lost quite a bit of weight wihout trying. First of all I used I try get in the gym and do weights when I could but ended up injuring my back. This was around June time last year and I done so much damage I was on strong pain killers and took 3 months to get over it - part of me wonders if pain killers set off this stomach problem - anyway I originally put losing weight down to not working out anymore and so losing muscle but the weight just keeps dropping off me. I was over 11 stone 6 months ago I now weigh 9 stone 6 (61Kg) without even trying. Starting to worry me a bit now I'm not gonna lie. Only good hing to come out of this horrible illness is six pack starting to come through haha but no seriously it is a worry and I'm starting to look ill now aswell as feel it. I live in Essex and think it's only from pushing the doctor that I got endoscopy booked but it's still been couple of months. I first went to doctors early November. Hope you all start to feel better soon. Tel"

          "Hi guys, I'm new to this. Apologies if I'm posting in the wrong place - just after some ideas/advice. Since the beginning of December I've been feeling sick quite regularly, particularly after eating food. This became so severe that over Xmas I was off work for a week, spent the week in bed feeling excessively tired and feeling horribly sick. I barely ate anything and as soon as I did eat then I just felt even worse. I've seen my GP on 3 separate occasions now. She has prescribed Omeprazole 20mg and Metoclopramide 10mg, both of which I've been taking for 2.5 weeks now. GP has asked me to change my diet and is putting my symptoms down to Gastritis. I should add, whilst I don't eat unhealthy food, I do work 12 hour shifts which include nights so the times at which I eat and the food I choose to eat at these times can affect my stomach. Bloods have been taken, but nothing showed up so as far as the GP is concerned there is nothing to worry about. But.....as I'm sure you can appreciate, there is something to worry about because I still don't feel well, and this is six weeks later. Making the situation a million times worse is I'm Emetophobic (fear of vomit) and so feeling sick stresses me out because I then worry that I might be sick and tend to avoid eating in case I am sick. No diarrhoea, vomiting or passing of blood accompanies my symptoms. Just the feeling sick and overly tired. Does anyone know what could be causing this and if there is anything I can do to aid recovery? Many thanks in advance for any help offered, Dec"

          " <p>Hi. I think you&#39;re reading too many text books. There are many reasons why someone&#39;s appetite diminishes. You&#39;ve got no appetite yet you enjoy eating, isn&#39;t that a contradiction? Are you having night sweats that absolutely soak the bed? Have you had a sudden obvious drop in weight? Are you suffering from fatigue? Are you feeling unwell? Is your skin an unusual colour? If you had &quot;late stage cancer&quot; you would have lost a large amount of weight and be extremely weak. Have your ultrasound, I&#39;m sure that whatever is wrong with you is not cancer. Which isn&#39;t to say that there is nothing wrong with you but more investigations are needed to give you a diagnosis. Stop worrying and let me know how you get on.</p> Thank you please keep me updated message me if. You need to chat <p>So ultrasound is confirmed normal, although &#39;limited images of pancreas obtained&#39;, annoyingly. GP isn&#39;t being very cooperative, thinks that my lower back pain, lack of appetite amongst other things is all just IBS. I have been feeling pretty ill last few days, have even found blood in my stool(pancreatic cancer not a common cause of this, but a potential cause nonetheless). Have back pain that keeps me up 2nd half of night that I&#39;m worried about, feels spinal. Gonna have to go private for a CT scan I guess as I really have not been feeling all that well last few days, unusually tired at times and have mild night sweats</p>"

          "<p>Hello, I am a 25 year old male, I&#39;ve searched the internet high and low but there doesn&#39;t seem to be any reassurance out there for me. I lost my appetite seeminly over night about 3 months ago. Over that time I have seen 4 different doctors and they have presribed various things like laxatives and acid reflux as I have also had mild digestive complaints on and off. None of these have had boosted my appetite though. I still enjoy eating and do so to keep my energy levels up, but I never actually get hungry and sometimes I get bloated after meals. I also had a colonscopy (I requested it) to rule out colon cancer and it was all clear so the doctor just gave me anti-anxiety meds assuming my lack of appetite was psychological. Only thing is I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s not and have seen another doctor who I persuaded to give me an ultrasound. Doctor doesn&#39;t seem too worried though and just seemed to imply I&#39;m a hypochondria.</p><p>&#160;&#160; Assuming I am right about the lack of appetite being physical, can I really be anything else but cancer? I&#39;m convinced what I am experiencing now is cachexia, or wasting from late stage cancer. I can&#39;t help but think it&#39;s pancreatic cancer with liver mets as I also have digestive complaints (have even had floating stools for a while now), I initially considered this just to excedingly rare in people my age but my symptoms just seems textbook. All in all just can&#39;t really believe this is happenning and I&#39;m terrified about the ultrasound.</p>"

          " I have been awarded PIP (upper mobility and lower daily living) each test is scored and you must get a certain number of points to get any money. Did you look up the scores before the assessment? The person that does the assessment does not know if you will be awared anything but gives a record of findings, this is then looked at. On the plus side any award given will be back dated to the date the claim was received, so you may get a large payout as it is such a long process. Good luck, remember there is hope, people have had PIP for Psoriatic Arthritis. Hi Robert I too receive PIP upper rate of the care component, nothing for mobility which I have appealed against so waiting to hear on that score. If you are not awarded it, appeal. Getting in touch with the Disability Employment Adviser at your local Jobcentre. Best thing I ever did  Good to know people have got pip just put in claim for my son  Hi Robert, just came across your discussion. I have psoriatic arthritis, and osteoarthritis. I was getting the lower DLA, but my joints have got worse, so I notified the DLA, and was told I would have to apply for PIP, this I did. I have to have a assessment on 18th February 2016. I am quite worried, as I'm not very good at explaining myself!! I agree with you, as I have given them my rheumatologist name, and orthopaedic doctors name. Did you get PIP after? "

          "Has anyone been for PIP assessment? I went yesterday not sure how it went i will have to wait to find out. But the Questions i was asked was pointless they only asked what i had written on the application to confirm what i had written, They have been in contact with my specialist who has confirmed my condition and spoken to other medical people i have seen to me it was pointless. They have all the information they need so why do they need to see you? The exercises they asked me to do where mainly pointless as they were ones that my condition is not effected by and the ones that were i could not do. Has anyone managed to get PIP for Psoriatic Arthritis or am i wasting my time?"
