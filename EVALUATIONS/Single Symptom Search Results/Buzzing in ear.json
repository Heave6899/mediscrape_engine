          " Hi I am in the same position as you, I have Atrial Eptopic Heart Beats ,it means i have extra Heart Beats single ,double and some triples a day,I have been given Atenolol, Verarapimil, both with only a small reduction in extra heart beats but both lowering my HeartBeat into the low 50s and Blood Pressure to 110/71 which is low.Now they want me to try Coversyl Perindopril which does Not seem to be used for irregular Heart Beats only Blood Pressure and Heart Attacks, so I have not even started taking them and I dont think I will unless someone on this site tells me they have been given this Drug for my condition, I suffer with Migrains so I dont want any more Headaches. sorry I seem to be negative but I feel like I am being used in a test trial . hope you get sorted out soon regards Roland Roland, Ive been on coversyl for 13 months from heart surgery (valve replacement) and have just realised that Im not going crazy, its just the side effects of this drug.. constant dizzyness, constant buzzing in the ears, bad temper, sometimes slightly depressed (not normal for me at all) and blurred vision.. Thankfully I found this web site and all your comments and am now off to my heart surgeon to get off Coversyl and find something else.. unusually enough I suffered from Migranes as long as I can remember, since the op Ive never had a headache, its wonderfull !!! Coversyl is reported to be a very good drug, and I dont doubt that, however, it doesnt seem to like me.. Hi Col and all you on Heart Drugs Col hope you have been given a better Drug, Here we are Jan 2008 and I am no futher to resolving my problem spent Boxing Eve in Hospital with Atrial Fibrilation and than a very slow irregular Heart Beat felt crap. will be seeing Cardiologist again for the 3rd time end of Jan, have been on Propranolol, Verapimil,Metaprolol,all of which slow my Heart into the 40/50 per min [b:0c39f42884]I tell the Doctors Do they listen ,They do not [/b:0c39f42884] hope this time for a result most of the Day feel crap Happy New Year to you all and hope you all get to live a near normal life. Roland:oops: Just found this site as I'm checking to see if my doctor's advice to double my Perindopril dosage to 8mg is safe. I've had high blood pressure most of my adult life (it runs in the family) &amp; suffered severe Atrial Fibrillation in 2000 which was misdiagnosed &amp; then mistreated....it was a debiltating, horrible experience. I've been on 4mg of Perindopril for probably 15yrs with no ill effects but it's not helped much in lowering my BP....beta blockers turned me into a constantly tired bear with a sore head so I'm happy to be on Perindopril as I get no side effects at all. My advice would be to constantly monitor what your doctor says &amp; (for me) beware of beta blockers. I'm resonably fit but yes, growing old sucks! Have been on perindopril for 6 months now (4mg), due hypertension. Side effects noted: After first tablet taken at night, heart racing all night and not much sleep. This settled down after a few nights. Since then: Often tiredness/fatigue/lethargy when not doing anything. Have to really motivate myself to do exercise, but once started seems fine. Cold fingers/2 numb fingers in right hand when temperature below about 14 degrees C. (worse than before on tablet) Blurred vision at times (particularly reading) Some throbbing inside head. Still have tinnitus. Sexual function very much decreased, erections a rare thing at present (yes, I know, TMI!). 1 skin rash (1cm square on abdomen), itches about twice a day. Plus side: Headaches greatly reduced, which used to happen regularly. Blood Pressure lowered by about 10 points on each. Motions very regular and smoother! (TMI again). Hi there, After reading other people's experience on BP tablets, I can appreciate what my husband is going through. He has been taking Coversyl 10mg for less than a year now, he has also complaint about the side effects he's been experiencing (ie buzzing in the ears, blur vision...mood swings). Most importantly is, it reduces his desire in having sex significantly, it makes both of us feeling depress towards this subject. As you may know, the more you feel frustrated and depress, the minimal the reaction. But we can't just simply stop taking the medication, whilst no doctor could precribe us with something better. Therefore, I wish to hear what other people have experienced, and how you dealt/dealing with it, or perhaps other natural remedies. Cheers, I started taking Coversyl about one month ago, The Doctor first prescribed 10mg which was too strong, I suffered headaches and neck pain. He has since reduced the dosage to one Coversyl 5mg at night. It works, my blood pressure is controlled and I feel great.  Question: why does everyone tell me i will never be able to stop this medication...does it damage the arteries? ... I was given this because of high blood pressure in the hospital emergency 4 days ago but was not really properly diagnosed...i'd prefer trying change of diet,exercise etc....any suggestions. I am new here, was on coversyl for over 10 years. I did have coughing problems for the first few months but it went away. I have been fighting wild Blood Pressure swings for about 10 months, from 225/153 to 72/48. Lately I started taking my PB in the morning, eating breakfast and taking it about one hour later. I ascertained after a few weeks that eating made my BP drop, at times very drastically. It also caused by bowels to empty which really curtailed by life style. After going to the doc, she was puzzled and ordered tests which I am going through this week. In the meantime I have stopped both my diuretic and coversyl and am careful about what food I eat. Much to my surprise all seems to be putting itself right. Have no idea why as everything was good for me for many years on this medication. Each one of us is different and it is only by trying that we can keep our BP in the normal range, Too high is very bad. I have been taking Coversyl for the past year and I have done extensive research on the all comparable blood pressure meds before starting. I can say indefinitely that this agent has the most evidence on the market in terms of life saving benefits and lowest chance of side effects. I am sure there will be a handful that do not tolerate Coversyl, but from what I have researched the risk is worth the reward. Rest assured you are on good stuff! I've been taking coversyl for about two years, mostly 8 mg but have recently convinced my doctor to reduce my dose to 4 mg. My side effects are problems with close up vision. Also noticing veins on my face. Salt seems to be the enemy for me and causes my BP to spike. Would like to get off drugs completely.  Dear Guest: I was reading your post, and it is as if I was reading something I would have written. I felt like you throughout my 40's and up until Sept. of this year. I had high BP. The doctor gave me pills, they sat in the cabinet. I was terrified, and my medical colleagues all told me to take pills. I tried diet and exercise but it didn't change my BP. I had a stressful job too. Then, in Sept. I had a small stroke in my early 50's. The emergency doctor gave me Coversyl 2 mg. and aspirin. My husband got the prescription, a glass of water and handed me the pills. Well, now I take them once a day. My heart works easier now, my blood pressure is no longer high. I can't say I have any other side effects that I notice. I have a sensory deficit in my left side from the stroke. It's permanent. I say, take the pill before the blood pressure damages your brain vessels. Yes, I can't believe it myself..getting old is nasty. Good luck, and write how you feel after.. Cheers.  <p>Hi, i&#39;m 41 and have been diagnosed with HBP (hereditary &amp; life enduced stress) about 1.5 year ago, doctor started me off with 4mg, then bumped me up to 8mg.</p><p></p><p>Systolic 155 146 143 150 151 142 135 146</p><p>Diastolic 109 107 100 104 94 97 88 88</p><p>Pulse 98 88 92 119 110 96 109 109</p><p></p><p>At this point i have the hottest g/f but 3/4 of the time i loose my erections during intercourse, it&#39;s never happened to me before and i&#39;m sure Coversyl is the cause <img src=\"http://s8.patient.media/forums/emoticons/sad.gif\" alt=\"sad\" /> in addition, my sex drive has diminished severely to the point that she&#39;s wondering if i&#39;m cheating on her or something <img src=\"http://s8.patient.media/forums/emoticons/sad.gif\" alt=\"sad\" /></p><p></p><p>Doctor told me all medication for HBP are more or less the same, that Coversyl is the best one. Still, i&#39;m not ready to give up on my relationship because of HBP..any suggestions?</p> <p>Hi all,</p><p>[b]?[/b]i have only this moment come across this site it is Aug 2016 and i live in Australia, the stories all seem like i have written them at some stage over the last 5 years, my incident started the way as most,in denial and thought i could beat the HBP through diet or whatever.I have a high pressure job at times in the Construction industry as a site manager say no more. Dec 22 2011 building industry christmas shutdown known as breakup day,didn&#39;t even make it to work that day, thought i was having a heart attack,felt like some alien beast was trying to rip my heart out through my back,the only comfort i could find until the ambulance arrived was to arch my back and not move a millimetre,ambulance came did what all good paramedics do and made me comfortable and proceeded to take all the nessesary tests to determine the cause of the discomfort,my blood pressure at that point was 235/180 forget what my pulse was,tests showed i wasnt having a heart attack but something was seriously wrong,I live a long way from the hospital,the quickest trip ive ever done.</p><p>[b]?[/b]Emergency dept took me in and examined and tested and tested some more to a point where they almost decided to send me home and see if things changed over a period of time,a young Dr suggested lets try a&#160;CT scan and see what that shows ill never know who he was but i owe him my life the CT scan revealed an Aortic Dissection running the full lenght of my Aorta from the arch down into my groin,so of course emergency surgery open heart the whole bit. five years later im still here to tell my tale, Coversyl, five years&#160;ive been on blood pressure medication and i would have to say its taken me the best part of four years to get my head into a place where i can function as a husband,father and work a full time job&#160;back in the building industry.&#160;coversyl&#160;10 mg twice a day&#160;is where im at now with another drug called Zanidip,minipress and metoprolol these four drugs keep me alive and i must say again i has taken four years to accept the drugs. the lethargy,the dizziness, the lack of motivation,i have a constant heart rate of between 38 beats per minute to an absolute high of 60,at that level im peaking and it feels like im about to explode</p><p>[b]?[/b]however sex was also an issue not being to get an erection to getting one and then losing interest half way through to not even thinking about it at all.slowly over time i accepted my situation and accepted that my body can funtion at a lower heart rate and i accepted that i may not have the best sex life,and i accepted that i was in control of my life and i wasnt going to die in the next week or so,suprisingly i sit here five years later writing this story, So Coversyl is a good drug, it takes time to get used to it,&#160;if you feel that you cannot cope with the drug please see your doctor and&#160;ask them if there is an alternative,again changing medications take time to adjust to,I dread the day i have&#160;to add or change my meds,its a long road to feeling normal again,my blood pressure these days is 145/90 when i get home from work down to 115/75 about one and a half hours after i medicate which i do twice a day im 58 years of age and im happy that i have drugs like coversyl ,its only years ago people died of complications that we now live with, thanks to pharmaceutical companies and brillliant doctors we have lot to be grateful for and taking pills for the rest of my life isn&#39;t too bad when i can still be part of my family and watch my children grow up and share the good&#160;times with my wife. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>"

          "Hi - I've just this morning taken my first dose of Coversyl, only 2mg, but will probably be increased in a couple of weeks and possibly another drug added. Now I feel like I'm just sitting here waiting for nasty side-effects to happen, and am quite frightened, so I wanted to see what experiences other people have had. My BP has been untreated, but very high for some years, and it is possible I have LVH (echo in 2 weeks to confirm). I have had these tablets nearly a month but put them away in a cupboard as I was too scared to take them. Am I the only person who has built up a huge psychological block about having to start medication that will continue for the rest of my life? I feel it might change me and my life, but I also know what the consequences of not lowering BP would be. Doesn't getting older suck?! :("

          " I have the same tumor that you have. I have had only gamma knife on it. Since then things have gone down hill. I have now got tn.i have had to quit work. I get confused,facial pain,high blood pressure and the list can go on. None of the dr. Can not really help me as do not know much about this kind of tumor. Just keep giving me meds. Your form gave me more answers than anyone. I now understand why my PCM wants to do a lung scan. He is the only one who really tries too help me. Thank you for the insight on what may come next. HI Danni Glad to help. Forgot I had written that-a few years ago now. Hope you are feeling OK NIcky How are you doing now? What should I be prepare for? This whole thing is starting to take it's toll on my marriage and me. Where did you get all your information on this tumor? I'm sorry to be so noise but I am so lost and have no one to talk to. I understand if you do not want to answer.  I live in South Carolina in the United States . Everything has happens so fast for me and my family. I was never sick before this. I am afraid it has gotten the better of them. More so than me. LOL. But I am the type of person who wants to know what to expect. My Dr. Has never seen these type of Tumors and is reading up on them for me. We are just playing a waiting game to see what comes next. I already told him I will not go thru Gamma Knife again. It may have been just me as the side effect have not stopped yet. I hate not being able to work. My tumor has not changed at all. And neither has the symptoms. So I am just in limbo. It will be nice to get my life back in controll. I am sorry that your marriage ended like that. You sound like you have yourself together. Sorry to hear about the tumor in your neck. But you sure do have some great Dr. Please take care of yourself. Hello nicgill, I just found this forum and like you, I am so happy to find this forum. I was diagnosed with Glomus Jugulare on 21 Dec 2015 which has blown my socks off. I am so sorry to hear about all the difficulties and trauma you have gone through because of the tumours. I do hope things are better for you now. I am not sure myself what to expect as i had never heard of such a tumour until a few days ago and my main symptom was a buzzing in my ear. I haven't spoken very much with my doctor about it as I beleive he was being kindly sensitive to the news he was going to give me and rightly so advised me not to scour the internet. I didn't take that advice. It's all I've been doing in order to prepare myself for my next visit in order to have all questions answered and to undersatnd fully what may lie ahead of me. I would be most grateful for any advice you could give me if you don't mind as I still don't know what to make of it all as I'm still processing the news. "

          "Hi it is so great to find this site and read all these other comments as I have never been able to speak to anyone with this condition before. I actually have bi-lateral glomus jugulare tumours. My symptoms the same as everyone else-was 16 when diagnosed, first op (18 hours long) when I was 18 -had to go to Manchester as didnt do in Northern Ireland back then. Tumour mainly took away-brill doctors by the way. By then I already had the deafness, tinnitinis and hoarseness etc which is how tumour was discovered. The first doctor told me I had a cold!! It took a doctor who specialised in epilepsy who admitted me determined to find out what was wrong who discovered it for me. The surgery left me with a half paralysed face and had to get my jaw , cheekbone broken to get at it but was back to work within 6 weeks. They grafted a nerve for my face which between that and the swelling to go down took about 6 months to work properly. It also affected my swallowing but soon learnt to swallow a different way and dont look any different when eating-though can only chew on the right hand side of my face re broken jaw and wasted tounge on that side. Then at 21, had to go back again as had been growing back (14 hour surgery this time). When woke up felt great and no changes to my face etc this time. Didnt get it all out so then went for another surgery again very quickly afterwards which didnt happen as the microscope broke down during surgery!! So the option for me was radiotherapy which I had fifteen years ago. I am now nearly 38. I have never had children as they since discovered the genetic part-my whole family had to do blood tests which went to Holland to help discover the gene, which they now have. I know that if I have a son apparently he wont develop it, but he will carry it and if he had a daughter only, it would develop in her. It came from my dads mum to him then I developed it. My younger sister never developed it. For years I went for six monthly checks, then annual checks, but within the last four years, my left hand side (the one I had all the ops on) has really started to prortude on my neck. I wear my hair long but I am very self conscious about it. The trouble being my right hand side has started to grow as I can now feel it-was always there before but could never feel it on my neck but now can. So feeling scared to be honest. The doctors say medicine has advanced so much since I had my ops that they can operate now if they ever have too (was told after my last op when I was 21 that surgery was not an option anymore because they discovered then that the tumours were also in my lungs) so the aneasthetic was too dangerous. The glomus tumours that spread to my lungs by the way have totally remained steady and never gave me any problems at all. Now the doctors say they can operate if need be but it will only be if they ever have too as is a very dangerous op. I just wish I could do something to stop them growing as I am used to living with my hearing etc. My hoarseness can be fixed-I had a vocal cord surgery repair but the tumour caused my soft palate on one side to stop working but they want to fix that. I run my own business and was married (now split up) but feeling very alone now as they are definately growing and feel scared. Sorry to waffle but so good to find this forum"

Head pressure seems to build in environments when not happy / comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Hope this helps !</p> <p>Heart palpitations, stomach cramps diarrhea, muscle twiches all over, buzzing tingling vibration in feet and legs, trouble breathing, sleep starts, ringing in ears, eye floaters, feeling of unrest. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing a couple. I have most of these every day or often and when I&#39;m calm. However I have anxiety most days and panic attacks often usually over symptoms.&#160;</p> <p>Agree, that&#39;s some list and I&#39;m sure we could all add a few more, &#39;normal people &#39;? I&#39;m sure think anxiety just means we feel a little anxious or stressed, I never imagined I could have so many horrid physical symptoms, . I know the thoughts I have are totally irrational yet the physical symptoms are so real. By far the worst is when I actually wake feeling anxious and my heart is racing, also when my heart races and adrenaline kicks in when I&#39;m out in public, this makes my hands shake and I get so upset thinking people notice. I cope better nowadays and know what to expect when it happens but it&#39;s still horrid, having more good days than bad nowadays, hope everyone who posts here gets some reasurance it can get better. Know when going through bad anxiety it feels never ending.&#128522;??</p> Those are all my symptoms too good list <p>Gerd, chest pain which includes shooting chest pain, numb legs, feet, arms and legs. &#160;Feeling of heart dropping or skipping a beat. &#160;Blurred vision. &#160;Shortness of breath. &#160;Pain in shoulder blades. &#160; From having anxiety so long I can bounce my pecs like The Rock. &#160;And I&#39;m a 47 year old female.</p> <p>I experience 20 out of 26 of these (if I counted right!) Chest pains and heart palpitations are by far the worse for me and really freak me out sometime. I always like to read about others people&#39;s symptoms. Reminds me I&#39;m not alone :)</p> That terry much sums mine up as well! I also get arm weakness in both arms, like they both feel extremely weak at times. <p>I can and have have every symptom on your list except the weight loss even with all the troublesome stomach and digestive symptoms and not being able to eat properly.&#160; I flip flop with diarrhea and constipation though. The ones that bother me the most are the classic heart attack and stroke symptoms because of the seriousness of them if they weren&#39;t anxiety caused. I also have periods of feeling completely numb, not like numb and tingling because I have that too, but numb emotionally.&#160;</p>"

          " This will not be of any help for you, but your comment facinates me. I have tried my level damndest to figure out what causes itching on the sides of my lower legs. It varies from barely noticeable to infuriating, but there is absolutely nothing to see. Bizarrely, in my efforts to stop it, I have rubbed on an insect repelent, which works. At the present time I'm battling a dry and non productive cough, because of Nasal Drip. I am unaware of any sort of personal problems with my stomache, except there is too much of it. Best. Tony Where do you get them? On your stomach? Do you ever feel like the itch is internal in your esophagus? Just off the top of my head I would have said that there is no relation. But, the other day I came accross a product called [b]Histame[/b]. It blocks the histamine released when a person eats foods that they are allergic to. I can't put up a link but you can do a google search. Regards, John I forgot to mention, rash is always accompanied by intermittent buzzing in one ear, and continious buzzing in the other ear. Hi Samuelson, I also exactly have the same problem. I am 35 and have no idea what is causing this problem. Only one thing, I could identify is, if eat more than half a stomach, itching is definite. Hence, I have started eating less and at regular intervals. Sometimes, I still get itching an and bloating. I swallow couple of gassex tablets from himalaya brand. This gives immediate relief from bloating and itching. But not having a permanent problem. It's already a year now. I'm only here replying to this, because I have exactly the same symptoms.. I itch and welt up along with rash.. I've had theses symptoms for years with no explanation.. A few days ago I was diagnosed with gastritis.. I think there could be connection  Dear Samuelson! How are you today? I know you wrote this over a year ago, but I read this just now...I am wondering what did you discover about your illnes till now? I have the same simptoms like you. The worst of all is itching all over my body...no one doctor here in Slovenia know what is it...I have this itching about one year. I had three times an gastroscopy and I was told I had gastritis, too. Please, I would be very glad if you replay to me. Thank you so much. Nice regards from Slovenia! Barbara"

          " I take my bisoprolol at night for the last 18 months, and it does not elevate the lethargic symptoms, but does ease them. The tiredness for me also has something to do with my sleep apnea Like Jenny35762 I also have taken Bisoprolol/HCTZ 10/6.25 mg at bedtime for several years. I started doing that because taking it in the morning left me with the lowest level by next a.m., leading to swollen hands that could not open a milkbottle in the morning, and I generally felt worse. Also BP tends to be highest at about 5 a.m. in most folks, as we found out in a hospital study, at which time the left-over level of Biso... would be at it's LOWEST in one's body system, {that is if you take the medication only once daily}... I felt an immediate improvement when I changed to talking it @ h.s [hour of sleep] There may be one drawback... If one's fluid intake is up @ + after supper in the evening, your bladder will wake you in the middle of the night, due to the action of the Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg which is a diuretic,,, + most diuretics work better + faster if you recline fairly flat, after taking the HCTZ... which one usually does at bedtime. If your HCTZ mg dose is 6.25 - you should however make sure to get about 2000cc fluid-intake/day or the HCTZ effect on the kidneys may cause you to be dehydrated... You can tell dehydration when your fingertips get wrinkly. Some folks take 5mg in the a.m. and 5 mg Biso @ h.s. to distribute the effect... yet I never have, so have no idea how that affects patients... I used to work in hospitals, so forgive the abbreviations. One more aspect is the strenght of the Biso-dose and how high the mg dosage of your HCTZ part is, of the tablet. If you have the side effects you described above, they seem too bothersome... you should re-evaluate these effects WITH YOUR DOCTOR.... BP meds are a very individual component of BP regulation and have to be tried out till you find the right one you can live with... yet I would definitely try using the medication @ h.s. first and keep a journal of your experience, then go see Doc. and tell him how the 2 different approaches worked for you. It depends how long you've been taking this medication also. If you recently started on it, I hope you have read all the side effects that might come your way. In my case I often have a low heart-rate in the morning, which is a side effect, but if I can live with the tiredness that causes, it is actually good for your heart not to work overtime....just takes me forever to get going in the morning. .......The other side effect I experience now after being on the medication for 10+ years, is tinnitus...those persistent Cicadas buzzing in my ears, and dizziness, which causes me to carry my cell-phone in my pocket at all times, in case a fall occurs. Well - that's life of a 78 year old....I wish you the best possible outcome !!! Wishing you well !  My consultant told me to take it at night. I used to take it at 7pm each evening. Many people with side effects take their dosage at night. I tended to do that when taking it. I did wonder if the benefit of the drug covered 24 hours or if it did me more good if taken in the morning when active during the day.  Queried this with the doc recently and was told there is no reason why it cannot be taken at night. I therefore take the whole dose at night and feel much better for it. It's no fun being a zombie all day.  Hi Charles, I take 5mg Bisoprolol around 8pm but cannot get a full nights sleep. I have tried various other times but unfortunately cannot find a time that suits me. I have nightmares and have had a problem with sleep-walking. I started taking Bisoprolol last September following my Atrial Flutter episode and have never been without some kind of side effects. I have tried to get my GP to put me on some other medication but he wont. Three weeks ago I started reducing my dosage by cutting the tablets in half and so far I have not seen much of a difference. I am still not getting a full nights sleep although my nightmares have eased. My head is still buzzing and I develope a very stiff neck in the morning which eases later in the day. I also take varying doses of Warfarin and Simvastatin. I am also 78 years old Charles awaiting an Ablation and somtimes wonder if I will ever get back to normal before I reach 100. Best regards Derek (Joiner)"

          " I agree I do as well. Hi Lynda, Thanks for the kind words and support. We are actually beginning to wonder if I should keep with it a bit longer until everything has settled down. I have another hospital appointment Tuesday week so, I think I'll stay on until then see what's occurring! I don't see my Dr until beginning of September however, I have the first counselling session next Tuesday as well so, I guess, see how that goes too! I would like to think I will eventually drop to a lower dosage or come off completely, but if I am too \"damaged\" I guess I'll have to stick with it! Lower dosage would be preferable. Coincidentally, I have buzzing in the ears for the first time in a while, but this is because I am a little tired (I think). While typing this we are discussing the fact that feeling I should be reducing (when I'm not) is not helping my situation either. So, thanks for the nudge in the right direction and making me stop to reflect, I have decided not to reduce until at least after the hospital appointment. You have to say that this site is the best! We all need help especially when we are too close to our own problems! Thanks Lynda. Regards, David x "

          " Hi Cliona, There is nothing in what you wrote that most of us have not experienced ourselves. Everyone is different and expeience different levels of side effects. These side effects are very common with Cita and the anxiety well, hit me like a train and I'm an old geezer or rather a mature chap who would have laughed at anyone who said, last year, in a years time you be llike this! Apparantly, Cita causes or increases anxiety before it treats it. That and panic attacks, nauseous, buzzing in the ears, feeling spaced, multiple dreams every night which left me feeling awful are some that I have had. I am 3 months in and came here like you, I was a little freaked out and not knowing anything about the problems I had, side effects I was experiencing or what was happening to me. Fortunately, the lovely people here, through their own experiences have helped in my accepting most of what may happen for the better me in the long term. Obviously, there are the hormonal differences in our bodies which I am sure some of the girls will be of more use to you than I, but all in all please try and persevere it does get better. There will also be ups and a few downs as you progress and if anything bothers you or you need to talk, seek advice come here and post for a reply. Remember only we know we are not well and others cannot see this, here you'll get understanding and all the support you need. Cita is a sticking plaster for the brain and here is the treatment and therapy. Hope you keep up with it, it does like I said, get better. Do not hesitate to contact the site how ever insignificant! Regards, David Hi Cliona, I too have health anxiety and I started 10mg of cit one week ago. I've also started to have CBT therapy. I would suggest giving the medication another week and see if your anxiety settles. My anxiety is always worse when I first wake up too. Maybe you could get a referral for therapy?  Me again! DUH! The last sentence should read: \"Do not hesitate to contact the site however insignificant you feel your question may be!\" Cheers!, David Hi Cliona, You keep fighting you are doing great, I was that soilder and I know how you feel, keep it up for at least another few weeks, things can only get better!!! I also bought some Zinc and Magnesium supplements as they are meant to help the nervous system along with some camomile tea and they helped me along as well. God bless x Hi Cliona, ive been on cit for six months, I recently increased my dose from 30mg to 40mg and its hit me hard, a lot symptoms come racing back. I was basically starting cit again, hence the side affects, thats whats happening to you, youre experiencing side affects, not nice, but sometimes unavoidable, I agree with Manny, give it a few more weeks, if things get worse then see your dr, but hopefully it will settle down a bit as your body gets used to the drug...... All the best...Luke hey cliona, wow your story sounds like how i started out. every little pain i had in my body i thought it was something different! got so worried about it and had suffered for a long time because of it mentally and physically! i then built the courage up to get help and although im not 100% i have had some good days! all my symptoms have basically gone now! i suggest you stick with it for a little while longer you having side effects is an indicator that the tablets are working! i hope you feel better soon tho! cassandra Firstly I think you have done the correct thing by speaking to your GP. From what I know things could go one way or another for you and I don't think anyone can provide the correct answer. Should you decide to continue then the side effects may continue or subside I dont think anyone can predict how this will go. From my point of view i stayed on the drug for a period of six weeks and still had side effects after that time and as a result after consultqation with my GP stopped taking them. Again the following cannot be predicted but should you continue with the drug and as you are suffering side effects when ever you decide to stop either as a result of side effects or as when you feel that you no longer need to be on the drug then there is a good chance that you could end up with some sort of withdrawal symptoms. Again this cannot be predicted but there is a possibility, should you suffer from withdrawal to a certain extent the longer you have been on the drug then should you suffer from withdrawal then probably the longer that both the tapering off the drug and the withdrawal is likely to last. Again for me i suffered withdrawal and still feel that I have some after 11 weeks of stopping Cit. If I had known about the possible concequenses then i would never of stareted taking the drug and if I had i would have not continued on the drug for as long as I did. I accept that this is a rather jaundiced view as a result of my experience, however I think that it is worthwhile passing on. Many people appear to use the drug with little or no effeect on them as individuals but also looking at this set of messages on this forum there are a lot of people who rerally do suffer. Something else which does appear regularly is that many GP's do not understand the consequences of the drug and therefore have to be treated like many other people making comments regarding this drug. I do hope this helps Dave  I would stick with it I am disabled due to a number of reasons however put on these after a been sexually asulted and 3 years. Now I am on top one 40mg but I could not cope without I am. 51 years young and weight as been better 2 also xxxx I'm in the same boat as you, I had a medical issue and soon after began to worry about it so much that I had a panic attack when a new symptom came into play, chest and arm pain. The urgent care doctor quickly prescribed me celexa without asking me many questions or giving me a proper psych evaluation. I went home and took a 20mg dose and almost lost my mind! the Anxiety was through the roof. I decided that night I was done putting anything in my body that made me feel so poorly, especially since I wasnt depressed or overly anxious before now. I went through the most awful withdrawl (even from quitting cold turkey off one dose!). Thats was monday and its now friday and I'm starting to feel better now that I believe the drug is totally out of my system. I havent slept in all this time and I'm considering toking up to get some sleep, but I don't know if that would be dangerous (seretonin syndrome) or not. In my honest opinion, if you really feel its not right then ask your doctor if you can take something else or look into naturopathic medicines that wont mess you up so badly. The withdrawal symptoms will likely be nast either way, even if you taper off. Be strong and make the best descision for your body and mind. GOOD LUCK! I know i needed it! Old post but - Ending citalaprom. - Ended taking citalaprom 20mg and amitrypyline 30 mg after 2 weeks 5 days cold turkey. No problems so far. Covered both by having 5 mg diazapam avaiable for no more than 3 times a day, though havent reallly resorted to them that much. How did it go?  <p>Hi Cliona, hi everyone that posted their questions and answers on this site.</p><p>I do really hope that in the meanwhile, they&#39;ve been posted three years ago, the problems have been appeased.</p><p>I am new in the branch...</p><p>Three weeks ago I made a very bad fall from high up my stairs at home.</p><p>I was convinced during the fall that I will not be landing alive.</p><p>The trauma of the fall was much enriched by the night at the hospital, the nausea, fainting, uncontrolled trembling.</p><p>The tests were all good, I was realeased to go home in the morning but then the most terrible state of anxiety started.</p><p>My house doctor prescribed xanax, I switched to oxazepam and a week ago he asked me carefully if I agree to take citalopram.</p><p>Which I very much agreed because the panic attacks were unbearable.</p><p>And then, exactly the way you described it, and thank you so much for it, it was a great support feeling less alone, the trippled symptoms hit me like a train.</p><p>When in such trauma after the fall maybe one experiences even sharper the tremor, dizziness, total panic, waking up at night, and the most horrible mornings.</p><p></p><p>I wonder, after a week, just like you did, if I should just stop it and continue with oxazepam only until I can get help from a Post Trauma psychologist.</p><p></p><p>I never took medicine, hate so much the chemical feeling that starts ruling your brain and body and would really want to quit.</p><p></p><p>Has anyone had a similar experience and did quit?</p><p>Or should I be also a brave soldier and continue ?&#160;</p><p></p><p>Please help me with your answer!</p><p></p><p>Thanks a lot</p>"

          "Hi everyone i developed health anxiety a couple of months ago after being ill a lot in a short space of time. my anxiety about my health is quite severe and gives me scary physical symptoms very similar to the symptoms of MS.long story short I became obsessed thinking about every twinge and it got the better of me. I spent two weeks in bed and then started moving up and about to find my mental anxiety got as bad as the physical. I'm on Citalopram 10mg two weeks since yesterday and my anxiety increased ten fold since day 2. My physical symptoms are more intense and the last few days I've been thinking very dark thoughts that make me feel like I want someone to put me out of my misery. I am normally the worst in the morning and night time. Can't sleep since started taking them. I've never had thoughts like this before and I feel anxious about things I never did before like my fianc\u00e9 and wedding and even cooking. Should I persevere or give up with Citalopram? Told my gp and she has left the decision to me but has given me the downsides of each. Help!"

          " Hi it's hard to accept that anxiety can make you feel so bad.I ended up in A&E many times had blood tests x-ray ecg,all came normal.I couldn't understand why I feel so ill.Doctor said is anxiety but I still think it might be something wrong with me Try to talk to a psychologist I am on medication for anxiety and I do CBT aswell.I am on Citalopram day5.Still fighting with side effects, Hi Jess, I had two bouts of dizzy spells last year before I, eventually, went to the Doctor with palpitations and shortness of breath. The first was in June and had two weeks sick leave, it was like my feet were on two different levels when walking and that I had had a \"smoke\" (which I hadn't. I had to hold on to things in the office to walk through and on the way home one night an elderly lady of about 90 asked me if I needed a hand as I was supporting myself against a wall! In August I went on holiday with my 12 year old daughter and we had a fantastic, relaxing time touring north Wales in a camper. Whithin a couple of hours of returning to work I had the exact same dizziness and feelings again! In November I finally saw the Doctor and she put me on sick leave, stated it was work related stress and eventually convinced me to go on cita. My symtoms are these, I have had nausea, a slight drop in appetite, feeling spaced, freaky, buzzing in the ears, raised anxiety, multiple dreams (some dark and vivid), overactive thoughts (some bad). Had aches and pains in various places. Citalopram apparantly causes anxiety to then treat it as part of the overall repair as a \"plaster for the brain\". I also have only been out on my own, 4 times since November, all within the passed 7 weeks, otherwise my partnet accompanies me. It was very difficult at first as if was very anxious and me a ruftytufty ex-serviceman! The \"ups\" are getting more often as now in 4th month and on 30mg however, each \"down\" is accompanied with being lethargic and wanting to go to sleep, I went to bed the other night at 8pm and woke at 06:45. Another thing cita has done is to inhibit my emotions which means I do not cry! I get a small wave of emotion which has gone as soon as it starts, whereas before I would have cried e.g. like watching \"It's a Wonderful Life!\" at Christmas and sat through it the first time in decades without a single tear drop! Libido is affected too (happens to women as well sometimes), which I am told will return (hopefully!) I started on 10mg and have raised each month by 10 and now on 30mg heading, I feel toward 40mg. Funny, I didn't want to start taking any drug and I was in denial, but after hearing and then experiencing the good it can do I am ready to up it one more time. Then, after the usual side effects of raising, followed by the odd downs I think I shall be way on the road to recovery! The Doctor I am seeing is fantastic, she knows so much about \"plasters for the brain\" I am very lucky that, my regular Doctor was unavailable at the time and I got to see this one. We are all different, it effects us all differently and recovery takes as long as it takes, but keep in touch here and posting questions they certainly do help! Regards, David Oops! Did you spot the deliberate mistake? Or was it? That being \"partnet\" I meant to type partner although thinking about it she has been a safety net. So, it could be an amalgam of partner safety net! LOL! Cheers! Hi Jess, That is the great thing about this site! It does make sense of the things we are not use to experiencing and when yer a little spaced, anxious etc., you get the support we all need here. It is like a crutch that someone lends you and then when you've been here a while you feel strong enough to loan it to someone else when you caand when you need it, you can always get another in its place too! Wow! I am feeling good today! Returning, seriously, to going out on me own, it was not like the two previous ones, just to the local store (about a minute away) it was a 12 round trip! My partner Ann (short for angel) had bad flu and I had to make this trip to spend the day with my daughter. Charlotte was fantastic, holding my hand and reminding me she was there the whole time, even though I was putting a brave face on the whole time too. The out and return journeys are a blurr, but the time with her I remember well. I am glad I had no choice and the strength to do it as it has helped as I went to the Doctors (about 8 minutes walk away) for a full health check with the nurse two weeks ago on my own, mind you I took some deep breaths when I got there and had time to relax. After I was very glad to be back home safe indoors! I look at it as a positive for the next solo expedition! Regards, David  May be the brain ain't working so well I meant to say \"12 mile round trip\" Hi Jess, what you're going through is almost identical to me. I fainted last year due to dizziness and haven't been right since! Had numerous tests and currently awaiting MRI results back from my head but the doctors are convinced it's to do with anxiety as all my bloods have been fine so I'm on 20mg cit... Only day 5 on 20mg so no improvements as yet, just feeling knackered and more anxious than normal! I understand what you mean about thinking there's something more in it than anxiety as I too have had harder times in my life than this but yet seem to be going through these feelings/sensations! hope your situation improves with the cit - keep us updated! :) x"

          "Hi, So I read these threads and they can be quite reassuring knowing other people feel like me. I started back in August with dizzy spells, went to the drs and they did bloods and prescribed me iron tablets as my Ferratin was low. After the tablets still know improvement so they gave me middle ear antibiotics. The dizziness has now got worse, at one point I even questioned carbon monoxide poisoning. Then after walking quite a distance one day in November and then stopping I went really lightheaded and my legs went weak and I had to phone my mum to pick me up as I felt like I was going to faint. Since Christmas these dizzy spells have got worse Prob having one every fortnight but now when I get them I have an urgency to wee so end up running towards the nearest toilet in a blind panic, uncontrollably shaking. The last 4 weeks everything has got worse with these attacks almost daily and it doesn't matter if I am alone or with someone. I'm having to get up in the night for a wee, my brain feels constantly switched on but eating helps temporarily. The Dr put me on beta blockers as they have put it down to anxiety although I felt perfectly happy and the only thing making me anxious is these attacks. I have constant brain fog now and am living in a daze. I started on citalopram 10 days ago and they have given me nausea which is wearing off now. I presently have constant dizziness, anxiety and don't want to leave the house although symptoms are very much present even when I'm home I just feel more secure in case anything does happen. I have been back to the drs as refuse to accept its all anxiety when it seems to be getting worse. I have asked for blood tests for which I get the results tomorrow. Does anyone else experience this? Could it diabetes as type 1 is in my family? I just want to feel me again as at the moment I literally feel like something serious is going on in my body and I have no control. I was really happy so am very confused by whatever is going on. Any advice I will be grateful for."

          " <p>I have had issues as well. I think it&#39;s my neck. You may want to go to a cervical chiropractor and have them do an x ray on your neck. Look up C1 and C2 and dizzy and see if that is you. Also you can go to facebook and look for groups. Type vestibular and many groups will pop up. Maybe somebody there can help.</p> You poor thing! I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t offer any help only support. I\u2019ve been having issues with fluid in my ear for years but only very recently started expediencing dizziness. I\u2019m asking for an ent referral tomorrow. I believe you that it\u2019s not all in your head.Some kind lady on here said to me the dizziness causes anxiety which then fuels the dizziness, I suffered no where near as badly as you and I feel like I\u2019m going mad so I can only imagine how bad you feel. It\u2019s very difficult to explain to someone. Maybe try explaining to a doctor next time you go just how much this has impacted your life and how much of a struggle it is to cope and ask if there\u2019s not advice they can give. I get the impression that it\u2019s sometbing they don\u2019t take seriously enough. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re suffering  <p>I have been having issues for several months now, been to ENT and had mri done on head, says there is nothing noting that it is to do with inner ear, even tho my gp seems to think it does... it&#39;s so annoying... I can not lay flat on my back without getting a dizzy spell come over me and I get so much anxiety from that feeling as it scares me, I feel like I am going to pass out.... the room doesn&#39;t spin, it feels like the spinning is inside my head.... anyway doc has referred me to a neurologist as per ENT requested to have them investigate the dizziness and ear ringing.... I have a couple days where the buzzing/screeching/annoying sound in my ears seems like it goes away and I breathe a sigh of relief, then it&#39;ll come back 10 times worse than before.... ughhh, this has happened several times now.... I have not been prescribed anything for it... I had a hearing test done and there is no indication of that causing the ringing... this is so frustrating to say the least.... I can&#39;t go anywhere as I am always feeling dizzy, nauseated, legs sometimes feel like rubber, aches and pains in feet and legs are crazy.... it is devastating indeed.... good luck to you, hope we can get this figure out and under control.... I just want to feel my old self again</p> <p>Hi Helen,</p><p>I know it is very difficult trying to deal with this illness which seems menial to a lot of people as they have no idea og what we are going through. I am 57 yrs old and like you said, thought things would be a lot easier for us. A lady I worked with told me in her 40&#39;s she always seemed to be feeling like crap and her Mom said, oh you will appreciate the 50&#39;s as you will feel like a brand new woman.... a couple years ago I brought this up to her and said your Mom lied about the feeling so much better in our 50&#39;s cause I sure as poop don&#39;t, she laughed and said she didn&#39;t feel any btr either... lol... I feel my doctor don&#39;t take a lot of the way I am feeling serious and thinks I am a basket case most of the time... it&#39;s hard when the people you should be getting the support from makes you feel like you are just making too much of things, it becomes even more frustrating. As for me, I have most recently been diagnosed with under active thyroid and on meds since Feb and have had to have strength increase since then... so last year in June, all my blood testings were excellent, I had been complaining to him several times throughout the year that I feel extremely tired yet can&#39;t sleep, etc... my skin had become so dry and been gaining weight etc.... he kinds put it off as well cut back on your eating etc, which upset me.... finally he sent me to have thyroid checked and yep it was out of whack... so now in the past year, my blood pressure has elevated, my blood sugars have elevated, iron is low and now have an elevated inflammatory marker on top of being slammed with the dizzy spells and ringing in the ear since January.... so yep very frustrating when I try to talk to my doctor about all this stuff and not getting any answers to my questions as he seems to shrug a lot off.... I have had EKG&#39;s, ECG&#39;s, D-Dimmer, all the cardiac blood work, lung/chest X-rays and everything there is all fine, thank goodness for that... it&#39;s all the other things to get figured out.. so yes, I do know that some of my complaints pale in comparison to others, but it&#39;s still frustrating.... . I am so sorry about the loss of your husband... I hope you find the answers to your issues with this also.... I do find it comforting to be in the different discussion groups on here and to see what others are experiencing in relation to the things I am dealing with also.... Take care</p> <p>Perfect excuse is the good old anxiety for our NHS system.</p><p></p><p>I wen&#39;t to A&amp;E via ambulance at the start of Aug last year. They thought i might of had a stroke but i hadn&#39;t. I had been 24/7 dizzy and off balance for 2 weeks solid and have been EVER since unrelenting. I had started having dizzy spells on Boxing day 2016 that had been getting more and more frequent and i kept mentioning it to my GP throughout May, June and July.&#160;</p><p></p><p>When i left A&amp;E my GP was told to do an urgent vascular appt as they thought it may be a vascular problem. Got my vascular appt and an urgent was going to take 4 months, yep 4 bl##dy months!! I had to phone, push and fight and it still took 10 weeks.</p><p></p><p>My vascular checks came back fine and the consultant thought i should see a neurologist so i was referred Oct 27th 2017 and was finally seen 3 weeks ago tomorrow, so i had to wait over 30 weeks and even then i had to complain or it would have been much longer. The neurologist ordered an MRI of my head and neck which i had last week.</p><p></p><p>If this shows nothing up i guess i will get referred to ENT and according to my hospital it&#39;s a 21 week wait.</p><p></p><p>Since going to A&amp;E nearly a year ago i&#39;ve been onto my GP 24 times and he&#39;s been so obtuse you wouldn&#39;t believe.</p><p></p><p>The reason i mentioned anxiety at the start is i&#39;ve had anxiety for 13 years but i had it pretty much under control until all this started. To be honest nobody has mentioned it but i know what they&#39;re thinking. I 100% know it&#39;s not anxiety related but my anxiety is the worst it&#39;s ever been due to all this and when i&#39;ve needed the NHS i&#39;ve been severely let down, never thought the NHS was this bad but it&#39;s dire!&#160;</p><p></p><p>I&#39;m 45 with a young family and not worked for nearly a year because of this.</p><p></p><p>Sorry for the ramble but you&#39;re not alone.</p><p></p><p>All The Best</p><p>Matt</p> I totally understand. I have been fighting this for 22 months. Been to ENT. Neurologist, PT for 3 months and specialist that day I should be better in 3-6 months. That was 18 months ago! I do not spin but feel like I\u2019m on a ocean all the time! Been off work for 22 months. Wish I had a solution for you but push for testing of the crystals to make sure that isn\u2019t your problem. You can YouTube PT for vestibular and start that now. Don\u2019t be afraid of damaging it worse it is already bad!! I have a hard time driving as well. No more than 30 minutes without pulling over to get sick! I am going to a naturalist and she has helped me more than any doctor so far. For the past 4 months thing have quit rocking quite so much but it is still there. 3 days ago I got worse again so going to make the 9 hour trip to see her again and see what has gone wrong this time. I set it off by getting on a pontoon boat thinking I was a lot better! Ha! Been very sick ever since! Hi Helen I feel your pain bless ya I was told mine is prob labyrinth but he said I\u2019m getting to stressed about it grrr I thought u try having this feeling 24/7 it\u2019s vile I\u2019ve got to stage I don\u2019t want to wake up as another day to fight through I like u have anxiety so it\u2019s making it worse and I\u2019m sure they think it\u2019s tht it came in after a bad throat cold virus I know it\u2019s not anxiety x <p>HI Helen</p><p>Unless someone has this condition they really haven&#39;t a clue how awful it is.</p><p>Got a massive headache today with ringing in my ear so taking it easy and trying not to get stressed. Every day is a battle isn&#39;t it. As soon as I open my eyes in the morning I hope for a good day. Don&#39;t think I will ever take good health for granted anymore.</p><p>Hope your having a better day. </p> Yea I\u2019m the same I get up and if it\u2019s not there I think o good but then I get up and I can feel the swaying off balance feeling grrrr . I\u2019ve only had it three weeks but it\u2019s getting me so honest it\u2019s the most awful feeling isn\u2019t it . I have the council in they are ripping out my kitchen and bathroom doing it all I was look forward to it the other month then I got this and just want them to get it over and done with and go it could take between two and six weeks . It horrible having people in your house when u are like this . The doctor just says it will go usually last three weeks well it\u2019s been three weeks and I feel no better . I bet if they had it they would get treatment straight away not just. Keeo saying o it will go soon grrrr x"

After having a good day yesterday with a slight bit of wobbly head I woke up to feeling c**p. Even my jaw feels funny today like it&#39;s to big for my mouth. Odd I know. Can I ask you all if you were given various tests as I have been referred for ENT but the appt isn&#39;t til November. I&#39;m on betahistine tablets but scared to take them daily as I read it hinders recovery. Not one doctor has actually said what I have but hinted at Labryinthitis. Been off work 2 months and no sign of recovering yet. I&#39;m wary of exercising as I may do more damage than good. I have another doctors appt this week to get another sick note. Should I demand more tests done as not one doctor has given any advice on how to cope etc.</p><p>I really am not coping well and not sure how to get through to the doctor how I&#39;ll I really feel. As I&#39;ve suffered with anxiety in the past I&#39;m sure they think it&#39;s all in my head. Wish it was sometimes as then it would go away.</p><p>This is a devastating illness which has changed my whole life.</p>"

You are going through a lot of terrible stuff love. these are ig issues you have to deal with at sucha young age and i really hooe you some family there that are loving, supportive and there to help you. hi i can really feel for you i suffer with depression, panic disorder severe anxiety and im also now an agorabhobic, i lost my uncle in september and then my fiancee sadly and sudernly in December what ive learnt over the years is that it things like this will obviously trigger states of panic and the dark thoughts that you are having are part of your anxiety talk to your therapist and they will tell you anxiety attacks set off parts of the brain we dont really access also the upping of medication can affect your anxiety and unfortunatly brain fog tends to come with most anti des i am so sorry you are going through all this but remember you are not alone and your not going insane hope this helps take care  Hi Paige, I think this is all just part of the anxiety and depression. I too have a lot of problems similar to yours and the fuzzy moments you've been experiencing I also experience very often. I used to feel like you, I thought there was something way more serious than the things I'd been diagnosed with, I'm 21 soon and I'm only just really accepting that it is just the anxiety and depression. My anxiety was that bad a couple months back I was practically out of my body for over 2 weeks, all I could do was sit and stare into the distance or lie down and sleep constantly. Sometimes it does get real hard and confusing but don't worry. You are normal. What you've experienced is just a combination of the conditions you're already diagnosed with xx Your ear buzzing may have been the start of a seizure but I am not fully convinced. I lost a college friend and last grandparent when I was young and it was not nice for me either. I think that your imagination is carrying you away regarding your IQ I am sure you are fine. Distorted thoughts are a symptom of the schizophrenia group of illnesses. I hope that helps you. rich Hi Paige, You have completely described me in all but the depression. I had all your symptoms, brain zapp, dissociation, derealization, depersonalisation, horrible empty like feelings, a strange sort of panic, fuzzy brain, blurred vision, all of it. I would aslo see things in my peripheral vision but when I turned my head to get a proper look, there was nothing there. Here is a poem I wrote, if it helps: Primordial Scream Deep within my psyche lurks a primordial scream It\u2019s not my life I\u2019m living, I\u2019m trapped in someone\u2019s dream Some are quite contented wherever they may be But me I yearn for something I just cannot quite see I feel I should be doing, having, feeling, growing But what that is exactly, keeps hiding from my knowing It\u2019s like a yearn for freedom, or a strange uneasy panic And you know that it\u2019s important so you\u2019re feeling mildly manic So I\u2019m going through the motions like an actor in a sonnet while I don\u2019t know where the bus is but I know I must be on it And life keeps marching forward every day, each week, each year And I know I\u2019m losing badly. It\u2019s a hollow empty fear But there\u2019s no given directions, no guidance, route or map, no precise instructions so the actor\u2019s in a trap There\u2019s no way out, no way in, and decades more to go If I never find the answers, it\u2019s a pointless wasted show Yet some are quite contented and don\u2019t feel this at all They just enjoy the moment and to them life is a ball There\u2019s nowhere they are going and don\u2019t care where they\u2019ve been They fail to understand just why I\u2019m lost within a dream But is there really choice here? Where does peace begin? What creates the yearning that swells and burns within? Where\u2019s the on/off button, the plug, the switch, the dial? Is this my great performance or am I here on trial? Terri Ann Laws  Hi Paige, I hope that the other replies have encouraged you to stop thinking that you are abnormal or unitelligent - you sound like a very intuitive, articulate and switched-on young lady. It's understandable from your life experiences so far that you might be affected by some health anxiety issues yourself but try not to self-diagnose - leave it to the professionals. I wonder whether you have ever had any counselling or CBT - you might benefit from talking to someone. It's something of a cliche but it doesn't so much matter what happens to you in this life, but what's more important is how you deal with it. In other words, our attitude. Those of us who care deeply seem to be very prone to depression and it somehow disconnects us from our \"normal\" emotions. The brain often needs help (medication/therapy or a combination of treatments) to help us reconnect with our rational thoughts and characteristics. It doesn't seem as if medication on its own is helping you through your depression. The intrusive thoughts are very destructive (they take away any peace we might experience) but we often can't control them popping into our heads. However, we can learn to deal with them when they do pop into our heads. I just want to encourage you to do whatever it takes to hold on to the peace that does come to you at times. Also, I'm sure I don't need to say that each moment you have with your Mum is a precious gift. Many of us squander the time we have with loved ones and miss the chance to make the most of our time together. I wish you well and send you a big hug :-)"

          "Hi everyone, I've just joined this website and this will be my first post so please bare with me if I take a while replying etc. Ok so I'm 19 years old, and I'm currently being treated for depression. I take 200mg of sertraline every day and 30mg of propranalol for anxiety. I have been on this medication for about two years now. Even though I am young, I have had an awful lot of life experience that I am certain has contributed to my mental health issues. Just over three years ago my closest friend suddenly died, some time after that I began treatment for depression, and started seeing my psychotherapist who I have now been seeing for two years. I suffered from panic disorder for a while too, however I had CBT for that and that seemed to help quite a bit. Just over a year ago, my mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer, with 1-2 years to live. It's safe to say that after losing my best friend, and still grieving for her, this was tortureous news. My doctor increased my medication at this point to 150mg, and just a few months ago it was increased to 200mg. I have had a lot of moments, even weeks on end where I genuinely believed I was going insane. I thought I had some form of brain damage. For the past few weeks I have been googling nonstop, trying to put into words what is happening in my head, as I honestly feel like something is wrong. Seriously wrong. What I try and convince myself is anxiety is haunting me. I'm not even sure if it is anxiety. I understand I am facing losing my mum, however as it has been a while I have had time to accept that. I am no longer in denial and feel as though I have made peace with it as much as I can in this situation. I understand however that it isn't a surprise I would feel anxious. However this doesn't feel like anxiety. It feels like i'm uneasy all of the time. Like something is very wrong. It doesn't ever go away, and sometimes I can't escape or distract myself from it. I feel like my IQ has dramatically dropped. I feel stupid. I have horrible intrusive thoughts, disgusting terrifying ones which I am too disturbed by to even go into. I can't even discuss them with my therapist. It is so difficult for me to put this into words. I have in the past researched bipolar disorder, as my mood does seem to shift. Sometimes I am so happy and can be at peace in myself. However the feeling of unease creeps back and knocks me off my feet. However when I researched bipolar, and discussed this with my therapist I found out that the mania is very very obvious and aparant, and he doesn't think I have this. Another thing I looked into was autism. I have suffered with dissasociation and derealisation/depersonalisation in the past (Which SERIOUSLY convinced me I was insane, most terrifying thing that's happened to me) and when I researched this, I read it was linked to autism, which scared me. I panicked about this, as I have noticed that I can no longer link things as easy in my brain. Like I'm slow, like the connections aren't working in my brain. But again, I don't fit in with the majority of other symptoms. I also have experience 'brain zaps' in the past, however this was mostly when I began my medication. This was actually what caused me to post this, as I had another tonight. It was completely out of the blue, I was walking down the street and felt like my brain had been electricuted. I heard a fuzzy noise in my ears and my eyes couldn't focus, and everything seemed bright. It only lasted half a second, but really disorientated me. Honestly I don't know what I'm expecting for from this post. It's so difficult to put into words how I feel. Something isn't right, something is off. I struggle to put into words exactly what is going on. This post is a lot of mumbo jumbo, I know that! I can't explain to my doctor in a ten minute apointment, and my therapist, as great as he is, hasn't actually experienced this. I guess what I'm looking for is just someone who can maybe relate to what I'm saying, or provide any insight into what is happening. I'm open to all suggestions haha. Thank you so much for reading!! Paige x"
