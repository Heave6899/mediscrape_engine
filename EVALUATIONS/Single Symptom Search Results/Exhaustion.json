          " I have also recently started taking 5 mg of Amlodipine and for the first two weeks didn't experience any side effects. However, I am now feeling like a zombie. I sleep for 12 hours then feel exhausted after just being awake for about 4 hours. It really is debilitating and today I have decided I can't tolerate the side effects any longer so I'm coming off it. I am currently taking Irbersarten but this wasn't bringing my blood pressure down enough so my doctor prescribed Amlodipine as well. Unfortunately I have a low kidney function and it would seem the options as to what I can take are not as good as lots of BP tablets have a detrimental effect on kidneys and also high blood pressure can cause kidney disease so I just hope my GB can come up with another suitable alternative. Would rather have high blood pressure than carry on with this horrible drug. Hi Nigel Just read your experience, mine is very similar, although I went from years on Lisinopril 40mg to this year 20mg PLUS Amlodipine 5mg. All went well for a while (3-4 months) then it crept up on me, I thought I was at the beginning of senile decay/dementer or even alzhermers (excuse spelling, forget how to spell it). I decided last weekend to stop the Amlodipine which did have an immediate impact for the better however I think I have been left with of the residues of it and I thought I would give the Am. another go. Now two days of it and I'm definately back to similar situation as yourself. Did visit the quack but no joy or advice as to the side effects we are having (wonder why?) so have decided to pack the Am. in. One other big draw back I have maybe due to the Lisinopril is lack of sleep or unable to get to sleep but when I do its nearly time to get up so at best I may catch 2-3-4 hours interupted sleep. This I feel adds to the increase in BP - so why do we bother. Anyway I am glad that I have read your report but sorry that you have been through the mill with the side effects. Have noticed from other peoples experiences we are not alone and the drug is banned in Holland - well at least we know why. Hope you get back to normal and find a better way to control your BP., take care. I took 10mg of Amolodipine for two months, after which I went from being able to run 15-20 miles per week, to walking after only 1-2 miles with severe calf cramps. After stopping using the drug for 1 week I was back to my usual fitness. I would never take this drug again. Yes Nigel very similar experience of forgetfulness, dizzyness and mistakes at work.Also paranoid because everyone was critical of practically all i was saying and doing,eventually lost job which ironically was a nurse. paul c. :cry: been on it for almost five years - have basically lost the last five years - sleep problems - cant sleep then can sleep but not for long its a nightmare - decided to look it up and i see folk have had similar problems - think i am gonna just stop it - cant live like this any more - cant function properly - like i said have lost years and i am only 38 AND i cant get that time back with my daughter - been an excuse for a mum for years and the depression ooo thats another story - basicaly had enough - stopping it now - zombie no more It looks like I've been in the same boat as the other people on this drug. I was put on amlodipine 5mg by my GP for medium hypertension. It only lasted a week before I came off it. It gradually seemed to be poisoning me, with the effects getting worse each day. Dull, zombie-like during the day, extreme fatigue during the evening, insomnia at night. I cant remember what I did at work during the 4th and 5th days on it. On the 6th day, I felt I was ready for a nursing home (at 54 that's usually a bit premature, I think). Blurred vision was getting severe. On the 7th day, my memory was so bad that I couldn't remember who the medicine was for - me or my wife! As my vision was so blurred, I couldn't read the pharmacy label on the box. I guessed it probably wasn't my medicine, especially since I couldn't remember when it arrived in the house, so I didn't take it. By the next day, I was starting to come round, and realised what had happened, so I decided not to take it any more. I'm now in my third week off it, and the mood swings are gradually getting less extreme. Hopefully, a few more weeks will get me back to normal. My GP was surprised at the severity of these symptoms, said he was sorry it had given me such a bad experience, and prescribed me some ramipril instead. When I found this site, I realised I wasn't the only person to be messed up by amlodipine. Ramipril seems like a similar disaster waiting to happen, and I don't feel like being an experimental animal again, so I think its time to get to work on changing my lifestyle instead of my prescription! What's the point of fixing my blood pressure with drugs if I end up as a useless zombie?! Hi! My name is val 22 y/o. I went to the quack yesterday because I felt numb. he gave me the AM 10mg. on my first time of taking it . I felt like a sledgehammer hit my head. so I went online to research and after what I discovered, I am Trashing these tablets. I have had dreadful side effects whilst taking this tablet, depression, weight gain, swelling from the knees down to feet, as I have osteo arthritus in my knees, the swelling actually made it worse. Muscle aches. Severe tiredness. After seeing the first doctor, he prescribed a water tablet. This did not work so I went back and saw another doctor and he sent me for blood tests, things still did not improve so I went back and saw another doctor, he told me to stop taking this tablet. Within 3 days of stopping this tablet I had no more swelling, felt happy, more energy, my knees felt loads better. All in all I felt well after 5 months of feeling crap."

          "I am a healthy 58 yr old and normally very active. BP was rising over the last year or so to 178/98 and so this Jan my Doc put me on Amlodipine 5mg. Thats when it started. Firstly with a loss of energy, then total loss of stamina, I felt like a Zombie all the time. As the month progressed I started to get forgetful, dizzy spells, very tingly left hand and painful joints all througfh my left side. BP did not drop as fast as hoped so Doc added Lisinopril 2.5mg. Hey... off with the faries now! After two weeks I could not concentrate on anything people were telling me and to the point that I was becoming detached from the real world. And that was only after a couple of weeks on the cocktail. I decided to trial which drug was causing this and first removed the Lisinopril for a few days then swapped over to stopping Amlodipine. Cor.. what a difference. Almost the next day after stopping Amlodipine I started to recover. After just one week people at work are now saying 'welcome back' and I know what they mean. BP not down yet but I am never going near Amlodipine again, its a wrecker! Has anyone else had anything like my reaction?"

          "Hello fellow Bisoprolol buddies - I cannot actually believe that I didn't think of doing a search on Bisoprolol earlier as it is so comforting to have discovered this web page. I have been taking Bisoprolol Fumarate 5mg daily for the past 3 years following a frightening episode in town which resulted in my spending a week in the Cardiac ward of our local hospital. I had SVT while in hospital and the 'specialists' couldn't actually put a cause to my soaring blood pressure and rapid heartbeat. So, I've been told to stay on these tablets for life... I'm 48 now, was 45 then. The comforting thing about reading the majority of these posts is that so many people are feeling ridiculous levels of tiredness; I don't recognise myself from 3 years ago. This isn't whingeing, just stating a fact. I have piled on the pounds - particularly blubby around my midriff - yet I eat less than ever. I am sometimes so overcome by exhaustion that I have to stop even the most trivial of chores. I have lost my 'get up and go', yet used to be so active with my three kids. I used to be so house proud, yet now can'tbe bothered other than to 'keep on top' of the housework. I used to love socialising, again, can't be bothered most of the time and when I do, I am glad when it is over. I love the peace and quiet of my own company so much more now and feel exhausted by company. Yet I AM ONLY 48 YEARS OLD!!! I realise I am lucky to be alive, to be uncursed by serious ills, but still, it is healthy to have a little moan now and then, and gratifying to feel online empathy with other 'sufferers'. I find that my partner and children don't really understand - can't blame them, I don't truly either. Take care one and all."

          " Hi - Just so you have someone reply to you :). Have a read of my replay to the post from they guy asking about migraine triggered by cheese. Thanks for the reply. The problem with your answer to the other post is, my migraines aren't triggered by anything, their just constantly there. Constantly there for 9 months. No matter what tablets I take, whether over the counter or prescribed, I can't get rid of the migraine it's self. I don't get auras before a migraine, I've had no 'warning signs' that a migraine is going to start, ever. Also no matter what tablets I take for the pain, their is nothing that works. In hospital I've been given paracetamol; co codamol, tramadol, diclifenac, combinations of them all, right up to morphine with no change to the migraine at all. I will give what you say a try but at the moment I'm just sure I'm going to be like this the rest of my life. Nothing works. Before January I've never had a migraine in my life, can't understand why it hasn't gone away in 9 months. Thank you for replying anyway, will see if it works Okay this sounds like something different. It may help to get some sleep. If you have decided absolutely nothing works then one could consider a synthetic Melatonin 3mg which one may need to import from Canada as it is over the counter in US and Canada but not so much in other countries. Dissolves on the tongue and taken before bedtime. Not really for repeated use - but results are impressive. I only take infrequently these days when I just can't sleep. Aside from that it is possible that it is a form of anxiety rather than stress per se, and if that is the case 50mg of zoloft I would have thought would lift one out of a tension headache \"cloud\". If you drink a lot of coffee and used to smoke a lot historically, this could be another angle, and if a form of self medication (previously), might suggest one returns to drinking coffee and move back onto a continuous intake of nicotine via a lozenge. Sleep and seronotin levels seems to be a factor here Please just treat this as just extra information from me and good luck in finding a resolution. rgds Rob  Yeah I've been trying to see my doctor to get something to help me sleep, as I'm constantly waking during the night now (never used to have trouble sleeping). My problem is that in a full time student and I work weekends as well, so I don't want to be knocked out by medication so that the next day I'm still so sleepy I can't function. It's a very difficult situation. I was never stressed at the start, wasn't until the last few months where it's been getting worse and doctors have been useless, that I've been up the wall with stress. Thank you anyway for taking the time to reply, I do appreciate your information and shall try what you've suggested. Yes I often think the same about doctors. It really does not sound like migraines to me ..these are often linked to a higher than normal level of an enzyme called homocysteine either for genetic reasons or affected by a deficiency in certain B vitamins. ...... but perhaps you are in that type of situation where if you lose a few hours sleep, it takes a really long time to recover. So maybe find a way to sleep better without being knocked out by medication. So lets have a think..assuming you cannot change your lifestyle, studying, deadline, working weekends etc.. Consider Increase melatonin levels towards night time to give you a more effective and refreshing sleep. Glass of milk at bedtime and banana (Milk contains melatonin). Concentrated \"tart\" cherry juice (high in melatonin).. magnesium from the other post (as a muscle relaxant). some night time mersyndol handy or one of the old style \"drowsy\" antihistamines. rgds  Sounds worth trying, shall start that tonight. I'm dying for a decent nights sleep! And no I wasn't sure if they are migraines, but nothing is coming up on any of the scans I've had done. I guess I should be really glad for that, but at the same time, I was hoping I'd find out what it is. Still waiting on MRI results to see if there is a problem with my veins etc in my head though. So fingers crossed I get some answers. Thank you for your help Hi, just so you know, you are not alone! I'm a newbie to forums so bear with me. I've had regular major migraines for 10 yrs post viral encephalitis. For me, major means being in bed for over 8 hours in sig pain, nausea and photophobia. Since approaching menopause they have ramped up to a daily all day headache for over 2 years and last month I spent 9 days in bed all day! I have tried pretty well all the prescription triptans and prophylactics: amitriptyline, verapamil, gabapentin, pregabalin, propranolol and topimarate. All to no avail for me but you may find one that suits. I'm seeing a neurologist now who specialises in headaches and after 6 months cold turkey with zero analgesics or triptans to rule out medication overuse headache, I'm now trying Botox. Hang in there. Try some of the sleep apps and cranial sacral therapy xxx  Hello, I seem to be in almost the exact same situation as you. I've had the headache for less time but doctors told me the exact same things and all tests came back normal. My doctor just happened to notice I have an overbite and said I might have something called TMJ-disfunction. I talked to my physio therapist and she worked on my jaw, after my treatment my head pain was worse than its ever been and other pain started for about 10 hrs or so. I woke up the next day and my headache was noticeably better. I also purchased a night guard from London Drugs as the disfunction can be caused by clenching teeth at night. It's now been 3 days since my treatment and I am going for another today. I was annoyed when my doctor said this might be my problem as I didnt think something like my jaw could cause that pain. But it did help. Your TMJ is located right in front of your ear on your cheek, if you push on it when you open your jaw and it hurts, that is what I feel. I read your post before I found this out and felt the need to share what I discovered because I was crying every day in frustration, I feel for you!"

          "Remember your worst migraine. How much pain you were in and how you just couldn't do anything. That's how I am everyday. Right so I'm a 20 year old female, I'm and student and work as a waitress part time. So, I started with a headache on the 18th January this year, pain killers didn't touch it. Woke up the next day and still had a terrible headache. I have a terrible headache all day, everyday, without fail. It's got to the point now that I'm stressed; fed up, hardly sleeping, can't concentrate at uni or any time really. Please understand that the pain never goes, the headache never ends. I have literally had a migraine 24/7 for 9 months now. I wear glasses (short sighted) but I know it's not my eyes causing the migraines. I've cut out everything that's apparently supposed to aggravate headaches. Stop drinking caffeine, stop eating chocolate and cheese. No change in the headaches. This continued for a week or two before I went to see my GP who referred me to a neurologist. The first neurologist thought I had tension headaches caused by stress. At this point, I wasn't stressed at all, not with uni or work, nothing. So I didn't quite understand this diagnosis. Anyway he put me onto tablets called amitriptyline, which is an antidepressant, and told me to gradually increase my dosage up to 50mg a day. This didn't help at all, had horrible side affects. I then saw another neurologist who diagnosed me with migraines, put me into Topamax, which are an anti epileptic drug meant to also treat migraines. I got my dose up to 100mg within 3 months and the side affects were horrible and didn't help at all. I've had a CT scan, which was normal. Had an MRI scan, which was normal. I've also tried Imigran and some migraine medication that melts into your tongue, with no affect what so ever. After trying all this, an idea was put forward that I could have raised intracranial hypertension, so yesterday I had a Lumbar Puncture. The pressure was at 19 and a half (apparently if its over 20 it's high), so it's not thought its that. The migraines were worse for a week after the lumbar puncture, I couldn't even sit up without being in agony and being sick. Spent a week in bed unable to move. I've got another type of MRI scan booked for the end of this month that's apparently going to look at the veins/blood vessels in my head to see if there is a problem there. I feel like I'm not being taken seriously now by doctors, because \"there isn't anything to be worried about, like a tumour\" as I'm always told! As much as I'm so very glad I don't have anything serious to be worried about, I hate spending everyday in so much pain that I can't function. Please don't think I'm over reacting/attention seeking/whatever, but I am literally fed up and can't cope. I can't get a minute of relief, I'm constantly in pain (different variations of pain, but pain all the same). As I'm writing this I'm crying my eyes out because I haven't managed to sleep more than 3 hours a night in that past 4 days. I'm exhausted and depressed now. I've even told my GP that I am so depressed now, I have thought on more than one occasion of overdosing just to end this pain. And he literally turned me away saying he couldn't do anything. I feel so defeated. If anyone has had this type of problem before or knows someone that has, please let me know."

          " Hi matt I am so glad you starter this post an that you have overcome anxiety especially without medication that's amazing Can you tell me was your anxiety daily and what physical symptoms you had an of course how you managed to overcome it Thank you Sam  I would like to say 'thank you' for this post. It imakes a refreshing change to read some positive words such as this.For me personally it has given me hope that I shall not be in this horrendous viscious circle of anxiety and panic for ever. It obviously pays to keep trying. If something doesnt work out, try another avenue. I still feel I have some way to go, however I appreciate that there is no quick fix. Onwards and upwards  Hi Sam, I hope you are well. Firstly, I would like to quickly point out to yourself, and anyone else who reads this, what prompted me to start this discussion. It might seem odd that someone who has been free from chronic anxiety for a significant amount of time would randomly make start this discussion. The idea of sharing my story/experience/knowledge is one that has occurred to me a few times. Up until this point, I have put it off, perhaps mainly down to reason number 2 mentioned in my original post, combined with reason number 1 (I simply don't thnk about 'anxiety' all that often anymore.) I heard a discussion on the radio on my way home from work today in which anxiety disorders were the main topic. This is ultimately what prompted me to start this discussion. I thought that even if my experience/knwoledge could help one person, that's better than not helping anyone. Apologies for that tangent, but I thought it was worth mentioning. Back to your questions, Sam. In the beginning, and for the majoirty of my journey, anxiety was with me at all times, from the moment I woke up, to the moment I went to bed. And when I woke up in the middle of the night, there it was of course. It never left, there was no respite. I suffered a combination of physical and psychological symptoms that seemed to vary in degrees of severity. Physically, off the top of my head, I suffered from palpitations, a heavy sensation in my chest (like I couldn't take a full breath), chest pains, feelings of a lump in my throat, sweating, shortness of breath, blurred vision, diziness. Psycologically, I suffered from bizarre/ridiculous irrational thoughts, I thought I was going crazy, feelings of unreality. This list of symptoms are non-exhaustive, and like I said previously, they seemed to vary in degrees of intensity and prominence. For me to convey one unifying method to recovering from chronic/accute anxiety is quite difficult. That's not to say that the process of recovery is difficult itself; I don't believe it is once you have developed the correct mindset and fully embraced/internalised it. My hope is that by answering people's questions, I can paint a picture as to how I believe you can 'cure' yourself. My ideas and methods will hopefully develop as this discussion matures and other people contribute. One thing that is vital to understand is that your recovery will not happen over night. If you want to be rid of this thing, you're in it for the long haul and you will WIN. And ironically, the rather sad thing is... You won't actually realise you've recovered. Why? Because anxiety and everything that comes with it will simply not cross your mind any more. Another thing worth noting, and it might seem counter-intuitive at first depending on how far along your journey you are, is this - ANXIETY IS NOT BAD. Embrace this thought, internalise it, because it is true. ANXIETY IS NOT BAD. Stop labelling it as being BAD. Yes, it can be unpleasant, uncomfortable, maybe unbareable at times. But, fundamentally it is not BAD. You need to fully internalize this fundamental concept for you to begin your journey towards recovery. This is not aimed solely at you Sam, but at anyone struggling who is reading this. I hope this helps a little. Like I said, hopefully my ideas/concepts/thoughts/methods will develop during this duscussion as I respond to people's questions. All the best, Matt"

          "Hi everyone. I'm new to this, but wanted to share my story/experience/knowledge with you all and help in any way I can. I know from my experience with anxiety that success stories are somewhat hard to come by. The reason for this, I believe is twofold. Firstly, once people 'recover' from this ilness, they carry on with their lives as normal, often without much of a thought as to how they were before. Also, I believe that for people who have a sucess story to tell, the thought of going on forums such as this to share their experience can be quite a daunting one. Oftentimes, people want to leave that chapter of their life behind, and not be reminded of it. I know this because I have been guilty of both of these reasons. This is worth bareing in mind; my point being that a lack of success stories isn't because they are rare, but because of the reasons detailed above. It's hard to say specifically when I 'recovered' from experiencing chronic anxiety. If I were to give a rough idea, I would say that I have been 'anxiety free' for around 2 years. Previous to that, I had experienced chronic, debilitating anxiety for roughly a 2 year period. I, like everyone else, considered myself the worst case - beyond help. I experienced all manner of symptoms; you name it, I experienced it. I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder and GAD. I saw a therapist, attended group sessions with other sufferers, but to no avail. I frequented forums such as this one and read post after post, all the while feeling more anxious and more dispondent (probably due the lack of success stories.) I will mention now that I am in no position to advise on medication issues. As bad as I thought I was, I refused to go down the route of medication. This is not to say that medication is a bad approach, but it was one that I chose not to take, and thus feel insufficiently experienced to advise on this specific topic. I will keep this first post brief. I would like to think I have been where you have been, and came out the other side. Recovery is not a linear path whatsoever, one of the reasons why I cannot name a specific point on my journey where I was rid of anxiety and its symptoms. My 'recovery' was down to multiple factors. Predominantly, educating myself tirelessly on every nuance of this illness. I have a degree in Microbiology and Biochemistry, so understanding how things worked at a biological level really helped me. I combined this knowledge with a new (read: fairly basic) understanding of Psychology, plus several self-rationalized 'a-ha!' moments to gradually alter my mindset over time. I am not a special case. There is not a rare combination of factors that meant I could achieve recovery and you cannot. I am here to attempt to answer questions you may have (not medication related, apologies) and hopefully help you along your own journey. I work a 9-5 job, and have several hobbies, so I will attempt to respond to anyone between these times, but I may not be able to answer all questions. If you do not want to ask a question, then please take this post as a tiny bit of inspiration to push you along your journey to recovery. You CAN and WILL be rid of your anxiety disorder, that I can promise you. To your success, Matt"

          " <p>Hi Chantal, I can say quite categorically that anxiety and depression can make you question your relationship with people, I&#39;ve seen it a few times on this forum and experienced it myself, they are intrusive thoughts which you ruminate over and it becomes quite distressing.</p><p>As your depression and anxiety lifts things, thoughts and feelings will start to go back to normal, you won&#39;t be like this forever.</p><p>I know my reply is short and sweet but you can stop worrying things will be okay.</p><p>Neil&#160;</p> Aw Chantal, you poor girl this sounds very much like anxiety and depression what you need to find out is whether you can do anything about this so you can live your life without feeling so sad. Go out, walk, talk to people and ask for counselling if you feel you can tolerate this, please take care, of yourself. <p>Hi Chantal</p><p>Anxiety can cause us to doubt everything I&#39;m sure you do love him. I doubt everything with Anxiety. It sounds like you&#39;re depressed also. A therapist can help you. Don&#39;t think you don&#39;t love him its the depression and anxiety. A therapist will properly diagnose you and give you treatment. Good Luck&#128077;</p><p>What I got from what you mention is that you feel better when distracted by doing things like hobbies ect.&#160;You were panicking the first two weeks with what you&#39;re describing. You&#39;re stressed out. Manage stress with meditation and yoga. &#128150;</p> I feel your pain. Am in the same situation. I love him, we get on so well but I have no interest sexually anymore, Ive lost interest in sex and this has been ongoing for about a year now. Dont know how or where to go, am currently under going councelling but we havent got on to this issue yet as I am dealing with so many other issues. I suffer from GAD and Depression and have done over 10 years. Every day nearly I am contemplating whether my relationship has a future, will I ever feel the same way again. I have also gained about 4 stone in weight with is making me very self consious about myself, how can I really love anyone else when I dont love myself <p>For me it made me think that people didn&#39;t love me and that I didn&#39;t love them too. But since it was constantly on my mind, it surely reminded me that if I worried, it was because I loved them. It&#39;ll get easier! calm down and take your time.</p> Hi Chantal I\u2019m sorry to hear you are suffering, although I\u2019m relieved to see you\u2019re post as I\u2019m struggling with the that exact same thing. It\u2019s good to know I\u2019m not the only one experiencing these weird thoughts. Me and my boyfriend have been together nearly two years and very quickly in that time we have had a beautiful baby girl and we have just bought a house we are moving into in the new year. My anxiety and depression has flared up again and I\u2019ve been so anxious around my boyfriend and I\u2019m getting the same thoughts, \u2018do I still love him\u2019. I only feel like this one I\u2019m anxious though so I\u2019m pretty sure it is the anxiety. But everything you have described am I feeling and it\u2019s very scary and upsetting as I want my feelings to go back to the way they were before. I was just wandering how you have been getting on and whether you have found anything to help yet? Thanks Jen Hey everyone, First I\u2019d like to say that I have been through all of this before. I don\u2019t have a history with anxiety or depression and neither does my family but I was unlucky enough to try an awful birth control which made my hormones spiral. In my first relationship of 6 years, about 2 years in I started to doubt us and have the \u201cwhat if I don\u2019t love him thoughts\u201d well, let me tell you, they were awful and I suffered for a few months with these. (I was not taking any medication at the time, I wanted my body to heal naturally.) But, things did get so much better and all of the love returned. We went on to date for 4 more years but the relationship ended due to things not even related to this. On that note, once again I was put on a different birth control pill and boom, all of the negative symptoms returned. I am with a new partner, he\u2019s truly the man I want to marry. I am so in love with him but I am so anxious and depressed all the time that I can\u2019t tap into that love. Not to mention being around him makes me super anxious because as soon as I see him I constantly wonder if we should be together. I truly believe that this is all due to anxiety and depression. With time the love will return and things will go back to normal. It just sucks that it\u2019s a constant silent battle within yourself. It\u2019s nice being able to share our thoughts and feelings with people who truly understand how awful it is. Just remember, you loved your partner before your anxiety. It\u2019s still there, you can feel the love for them again. "

          "<p>Hello, thanks for reading and I apologize for the length.&#160;</p><p>About a month and a half ago, something happened in my relationship (my fault) that kind of triggered (at first) an enormous amount of guilt.. which then subsided a little bit. I was good for a few days and then bam... &quot;do I love him?&quot; a thought so truly devastating and painful that I was crying all day. A man, so loyal...loving...caring...truly the love of my life. We have a relationship like you&#39;ve never seen before. It&#39;s so unique and that&#39;s what makes it so special. But when these thoughts started... I truly feel like I&#39;ve lost myself. These thoughts give me multiple breakdowns a week.. cause me to feel extremely overwhelmed everyday. I feel tired, exhausted.. I don&#39;t fantasize about my future anymore because the want to &quot;live&quot; is kind of gone. (Not a [b]suicide[/b] threat). &#160;Before all of this... my boyfriend made me so damn happy. Everyday, my love truly grew stronger for him. We talked about our future, and what we want. We have all of it in common. &#160;I can still be sexual with him some days. But when I overthink and get these thoughts...I cannot. It&#39;s truly killing me because I don&#39;t want to end things with him... all I want to do is get back to being happy with him. I keep getting these intrusive thoughts like &quot;do I love him&quot; &quot;what if I will feel like this forever and the only way to get better is if we leave each other&quot;. I cannot be without him.. everything we&#39;ve talked about.. all the memories we made. He truly loved me to the core and I do too.. but these thoughts are killing me. When we&#39;re apart, like rn.. we sleep on the phone together every night and it&#39;s something I can&#39;t not do. I cry to him over the phone, explaining to him how much this is hurting me. He tries to understand to the best of his ability and he&#39;s as supportive as he can be. Could I be depressed and anxious? The first 2 weeks of this issue.. I was lying in bed all day all night.. I was sweating with a cold feeling and every noise I heart scared me and made my heart race. I did not eat, I did not sleep right. Just so many issues that have again, slowed down a bit. What should I do? &#128542;. The only time these feelings kinda go away is when I do things together with my boyfriend. When I&#39;m alone and SOMETIMES with him, the thoughts hit me and I just want to cry. I don&#39;t feel free.. I feel trapped in a pool of my own thoughts trying to eat me alive. Please help me&#128542;</p>"

          " Hello First of all in you had two lots of ab's and they did not really work then is it worth having another lot normally if you are on ab,s they would kick in by about the 3-4th day also i would be wary as to why if you chest was clear why is he also presrcribing more for you not sure if this will be any help or not....but for the last two weeks i have not been feeling well, the first week i had all the symptoms of starting a cold, then on Sunday last i started a cough. For the first few days i had an excruciating throat then green catarrh and then started cough quite badly often ending in an urge, it also made me feel nauseous. then on Thursday i started having pain in my jaw, chest and into my back, i thought it was indigestion so would have a mint and a glass of water but realized that this was not curing it, in the evening had some painkillers it took the edge of it, then on Friday it was there most of the day and then slowly got worse to the point i thought that i had or was having a heart or angina attack. In desperation i rang my husband who was no where near home and so i then rang the doctors and they fit me in at the end of surgery,..... the result was that she checked me over temp, bp (that is another story) then listened to my chest, i was not wheezy then she poke and prodded my back and asked me if it hurt and i said very much so she then told me that i had got costochonditus and did not need ab's as i have no infection but just to take regular painkillers, so so could this be what you have got from all the coughing and other symptoms,. maybe there are others who can comment on it,. hope this helps :| Thank you for your advice.. That could be a possibility but I don't have pain in my back but do around the right hand side of my rib cage, almost underneath my right breast. I'm really not liking these tablets either. They leave a terrible taste in my mouth and are making me feel quite unwell. Also this evening, I have noticed my cheat feeling raspy again and the glands in my neck have enlarged! I wish there was something I could do to feel myself again. Hope you get better soon! Sounds horrendous but not too dissimilar to the pain I experienced!!  You feeling any better? I had a strange cold which turned into chest infection on the lower part of the left lung. Was prescribed amoxycillin and an inhaler as I was wheezing too (something I have never done or suffered from). Doc said if I didnt feel any better to go back, was at the nurse 2 days later for a routine check and asked how long I should wait before going back as the Doc thought I might also need a course of steroids. She gave me steroid prescription there and then. Finished all medication on Monday past but was back yesterday as still wheezing and breathless, lower part of lung still crackly. Now on clarithromycin and another 5 days (40mg at once per day) of steroid - prednisolone. Today I feel quite a bit more \"me\". Still wheezing and a bit breathless but not nearly as bad. I'm back for a checkup next Thursday, so fingers crossed. January has been a poop month so far. Take care.  hello are you any better. I still have loads of catarrh and am still coughing and the pain has come back at myu back and by the shoulder blades. also had a nose bleed today hope you have got to the bottom of your problem Hi My first post on this site. I've been in a very similar situation for 2 weeks now. I've been to docs and gave me amoxicillin but my chest pains are getting worse !! How are you getting on now ?? Any advice on what can help me..... I'm a 36 yr old male 6ft 1inch and feel like crying !! Sad to say that I have exactly the same thing. Started in October as a heavy cough and went from there. Had Amoxi and claritho. Now on a steroid pump. Chest has really started hurting at base of trapezius. Was hoping this was persistent coughing but not sure now. Have had some solid mucus in cast form - checkout \"plastic bronchitis\". Off to the states on Monday and worried I will take a turn for the worst whilst on my trip( business). Feel like I am getting on top of the cough and mucus. Have had white frothy, green and pink catarh , as well as the solid casts. Had this once before for 2-3 months. Was during my divorce and hence stress related ( consistent with some papers on plastic bronchitis). Two days left of the steroids. Has ruined Xmas party season, Xmas , new year etc through persistent hacking and hence lack of sleep and total exhaustion. Every spare minute I'm not at work , I collapse on the sofa or in bed . I am diabetic hence suppressed immune system really doesn't help. Symptoms are noticeably worse when my sugars are high. Nightmare. Slightly comforted to know others have the same thing as thought I was on my way!! Will follow this thread . Can anyone who is further along with this give us poor souls some light at the end of the tunnel please? Hi, I hope you are starting to feel a bit better now. I experienced the same thing several years ago and had 6. courses of antibiotics before my chest infection and sinus infection finally cleared up. Like you I developed pain in my right side under my rib cage and in my shoulder blade which felt a bit like a. pulled muscle, which my doctor advised me is pleurisy where the lining of the pleura becomes inflamed and rubs every time you breathe. It made me feel exhausted and very low, I struggled to breathe doing simple tasks. As long as any cause or infection is treated then the only real treatment is painkillers and rest. I am currently suffering with pleurisy again only this time I have not had any infection, the doctor thinks it was caused by a virus as I have a weakness in my chest. I have had it now for 3 weeks and still feel pretty exhausted after getting washed and dressed in the morning, like you I haven't really been out for days. The best advise I have is just rest as much as possible and keep up the painkillers. Movement really seems. to make me worse so although it is frustrating I am doing a lot of sitting around. Try and stay positive, it will pass eventually.  Hi Caroline. Thanks for your response. The chest is now clear thanks. I do have chronic backache and rib ache still though. Your explanation seems to feel right. The only thing I can liken it too is a partially slipped disc but I haven't done anything to warrant that! I guess it will pass as you say. I have a ten hour flight Monday, so at least I get to sit still for a while! Take care mark.  Hi!! I hadn't realised I had so many replies to this post until today!! I am much better now and thankfully have had no reoccurance of that episode last year!! It turned out eventually that I had pneumonia which caused pleurisy and it was around 3 months before I felt back to normal health. My father has just been admitted to hospital with fatal IPF (ideopathic pulmonary fibrosis) hardening of the lungs. He used to be a heavy smoker but gave up 20 years ago!! There is nothing they can do for him other than try to help his symptoms via warm oxygen and IV steriods. This doesn't appear to be helping as yet but the prognosis doesn't look too good and he's only 64!! I'm not sure if anyone knows anything or anyone that has this disease but would appreciate any advice!! Thanks again for your advice  What lead me to this site today was an attempt to find some information and relief from this terrible virus which apart from the fever which has now lowered, shows no signs of improvement whatsoever. The pain in the back & lungs became so severe that at one point i was coughing up blood and my fever rose to 103. The phlegm almost choked me and sleep became impossible. The noise and wheezing from my chest is so loud and no amount of coughing can clear it. I feel like I am being smothered. The doctor gave me a five day course of A/B. They didnt touch it at all. I'm now on my second course. Clarithromycin. but even those have had little effect. My skin also feels sunburnt and I am totally and utterly exhausted now. Today, even raising my head or arms became an effort. Absolutely every joint hurts. The cough is crippling me and I dont even have the strength to get from one room to another. Personally, I believe this is either a superbug, or a form of viral pneumonia. Over the years I have colds and flu, but absolutely nothing like this has ever had such a debilitating effect and I;'m a 6'3 male. This is absolutely horrendous. I would be interested to know if anyone has any thoughts as to where they may have contracted this. I believe I caught it after a visit to my local hospital. Before then, I never had any sign of anything like this, but nothing I do or take seems to improve it."

          "I really hope someone can give me some advice. Before Christmas I came down with a cold which turned into a chest infection. I didnt go to a GP as usually these things clear up. However by Christmas Eve I was starting to feel pretty bad and called the doctor but they were closed so I didn't go. Went on the 27th and was diagonosed with a chest infection and given Amoxicillin. I finished taking these but still felt bad and started to develop a pain under my right breast, almost like a pulled muscle or bruising of the ribs... I asked a doctor and he checked my pulse to rule out a pulmonary embolism???? and said you have pulled a muscle from coughing.... With that I left and carried on taking Ibuprofen which helped ease the pain. The Monday I had a strange incident where my heart was beating really fast and irregular and I felt sweaty, dizzy and couldnt stop shaking. I went home from work and thought about going to the doctors. Plus the pain in my right side was getting worse. I went back to the gp who said I was probably suffering with Pleuritic pain from the infection and he described me more antibiotics.. Amoxiclav... I still felt bad and he asked me to go back the following Friday to check my blood pressure as it was slightly high. Finished the Amoxiclav and suddenly felt bad again... nothing I have ever expereienced. Chest Pain, really bad cough, weak sweaty, extremely exhausted...no sense of smell, taste etc... so tired. I went back again to the gp and broke down in tears as now the middle of January and things seem to be getting worse. He took blood and sent me to the hospital for a chest xray and the blood test he states shows an infection but no blood clot on the lung. The chest xray has also returned clear??? I rarely go the the doctors but he almost made me feel like a hyperchondriac... He prescribed me more antibiotics but this time Clarithromycin 500mg twice per day. I was hoping these would have kicked in by now but still feeling terrible and am taking these alongdside extra strength Ibuprofen and paracetamol for the pain in my chest. I am starting to wonder if I will ever get better. I feel so low and down, I havent left the house for days and just want to sleep as I am feeling so exhausted. Has anyone suffered from anything similar or know how long it takes to get over this... Its been over a month now and I just cant remember what it feels like to feel normal... Sorry for the long post..."

          " Just want to say congratulations, and thanks for the advice x Thank you :) I think it's important to share good news and tips as well as the bad. x It's great to hear that your are of the meds and doing great :). I wish I had come across this before. I have gone completely to zero after a year of taking the meds. I am having the most horrendous withdrawals, that I don't know if to go back on them or continue. I am so scared :( Hi Evyivy, I am so sorry to hear that you're having bad withdrawal symptoms. I know from earlier on that when I tried to reduce my effexor too soon my symptoms were quite nasty - I would not wish that on anyone. Do you mind if I ask how long you have been taking no medication, what dose you decreased from and how rapidly? I really think that your withdrawal symptoms will pass completely if you taper slowly enough. From what I understand taking things slowly is key. Also, if it provides any hope, after about 1.5 to 2 months post effexor I feel great and have had no ongoing side effects. Importantly, do you have a supportive GP who knows about what you're going through? It is always good to check in with them for emotinal and physical support. Perhaps he/she can also help treat some of the side effects (eg with anti-nausea meds). If you have any questions about my experience, I will be happy to let you know. Best of luck - I really hope thngs get better for you soon. xx PS. I was also wondering if anyone has had any luck reducing their weight post-effexor. My weight will not budge, despite diet control and exercise. Any news of positive results would be so wonderful.  hi I am back, sorry for no replying sooner. Thank you, thank you, thank you for your advice. I haven't been able to reply sooner as I became very ill. Going cold turkey from these meds is not a good idea. Although I feel proud of myself as I am now off the meds, it was a very dangerous thing to and I went to hell and back. I am still suffering the withdrawals, today has been particularly bad with the dizzy spells, unsteady vision and brain zaps. I think I was feeling better and then tried to catch up on everything! ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU XXX Hi Evyivy, I'm so glad to hear that things are going better for you! It can be such a scary time, but you will get through it! Good luck with everything- I'll be thinking of you, as I'm sure many others will be! xx G'day Oz82 Your wisdom comes from experience ... and I am so glad when I Googled Venlafaxine withdrawal this morning I clicked on this thread. I have been feeling quite wretched and the strength and support offered by your words came shining through to me. I reached a point a two or three weeks ago when I thought not only was Venlafaxine not controlling my fibromyalgia pains and stress but my body, especially digestive system, was reacting to the point that I wanted to stop it immediately ... which I did. I mentioned it to nobody but know now that the side-effects are a lot to handle on your own. I know the way to go is forwards but have taken from your words some courage to perhaps share some of this burden. Thank you.  Hi - firstly, thank you so much for sharing this! I have been on 225 mg (capsules) per day for the past 8 years. I am now 26 and looking to reduce my dose slowly to come off permanently. Two weeks ago I reduced my dose by 37.5 mg to 187.5 mg per day, and haven't really noticed any side effects until a few days ago when I noticed I was feeling incredibly tired, had a strong headache (very unusual for me) and was very short and irritable with people. Have had no nausea - if anything my appetite has increased! My weight has remained steady throughout my time taking Effexor, and has always been on the low end (BMI = 19.5). My plan is to continue taking 187.5 for the next 2.5 months - I don't think there's anything wrong with taking things slowly and being careful. After all, if you've been on Effexor this long - what's another year to come off it? I have also tried to come off in the past by reducing 37.5 mg per month - had to go back to regular dose once I hit 150 mg. Will try to remember to update later down the track.  I couldn't agree more with oz82. I just came off Effexor 300 mg daily (4 x 75 mg) after 6 years. I tried twice but went way too fast. First time I ended up so badly depressed I could not get out of bed nor eat for almost 2 weeks. But for my boyfriend at the time I don't know what would have happened. Second time I went still a bit too fast and had to swing to a halt at 150 mg due to withdrawal symptoms. I then tapered down to 75 mg with moderate to severe symptoms but hung in there until I stabilized. Then I dropped down to 37.5 mg which was a breeze compared to the 75 mg drops. I waited again until stabilized and then dropped the last 37.5 mg. I have to honestly say, I have a very high tolerance for pain and discomfort but withdrawing from Effexor is not for the faint hearted. The best advice is go slow, slow and slow. I just want to congratulate you. What you have done is commendable and as I know from experience a hard thing to do. I too was on venlafaxine xr 225mg for 8 years. The reasons I was put on it was because of a situation that caused depression, panic attacks which led to seizures and it replaced other medications that I had been on for almost 30 years for the same reason. I have tried to wean off of it twice before but with no help from my gp. I was diagionised with Afib last summer and the cardiologist wanted me off as the venlafaxine was working against my heart medications. Still my gp would not help. I was referred to a Psychiatrist who, thank goodness, agreed with my cardiologist. I started weaning last October 37 1/2 every time the side effects cleared up from the last weaning. I took my last pill the third week of February and although I still have some side effects have had no depression, panic attacks or seizures. I am sure the other side effects will disappear eventually. When I saw my gp for other reasons last week and told him I was off the venlafaxine what did he do but offer me more. Sometimes you just have to wonder."

          "Hi guys, After 6 long years on venlafaxine, I have finally gotten off the drug. I don't know if this will be of any use to anyone, but I wanted to share some hopeful words and tips for anyone trying to come off of this nasty medication. I should clarify, however, that I am not angry for having been put on this medication, as I am sure it saved my life. That being said, 6 years, 225mg/day and an additional 20kg later (!!! just awful !!!) I am so glad to be Effexor free. The details: I was taking Effexor XR and had been on my maximum dose for 3.5 years. Prior to that I was on 150mg for about 2 years. I took 3 x 75mg capsules every morning as a once a day dose. Taking three tablets was initially to save money (for some reason it was cheaper here in Australia to do it that way) but it ended up having the extra bonus of making withdrawal easier. What worked for me may not work for everyone, but this is the approach my GP and I came up with. Most was my own plan, based on what I found worked, but my GP gave me the initial \"tablet dropping\" idea and trusted me to take it slowly, listen to my body and see her as needed. It worked very, very well, with minimal side effects. If it helps even one of you it will be worth having posted this. First things first: 1. Make sure you are taking care of yourself and are in a good place emotionally before even contemplating withdrawal. 2. You are going to need supportive people around you- I don't know if I could have done it without my boyfriend. Tell your family/friends AND DOCTOR what you are doing. This is crucial. You may also want to tell someone you trust at work what is going on, so they know why you may seem a little dazed every so often. 3. Make sure you are eating really well. I switched to a vegan diet about half way through and, although this is not for everyone, this made withdrawal so much easier. I am sure the huge amounts of vegetables made a difference. I especially noticed that days when I ate lots of sea vegetables I coped best with symptoms, so consider working them into your normal diet. 4. Take a multivitamin and drink lots of water. At least 2 litres a day. This will help minimise the horrible nausea you will probably experience. 5. Drink ginger tea/use ginger. This is also for the nausea and I found it was essential in the days after stopping completely. It really does help. I also wondered if some people might find a prescription for maxalon or stemetil helpful, as the nausea and dizziness was the worst for me. 6. Get lots of sleep. I mean heaps of it. Anyone who has withdrawn from this med (or even skipped a dose!) knows how tired you will get. Now the tablet reduction: I started by reducing my total weekly dose by 1 tablet per week (taking 2 tabs one day and 3 every other day) for a few weeks. This sounds like nothing, but even this produced quite bad side effects at first (teariness, exhaustion, dizziness and nausea). Only when I was comfortable (ie no side effects) with this dose regimen did I move on. Then, I took 2 tabs instead of 3 on two days a week for a few weeks until I was comfortable (making sure to space the 2 tablet days out, eg Sat and Wed). Then I got into the habit of taking tablets as follows. I made sure to plan/write all of this down on our calender beforehand, to use as a guide and make sure I didn't mess it up: 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2 etc for about 3 to 4 weeks Then: 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2 etc for about another 3 weeks to month. Then: 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, etc for about a month. Then when I got to 2 tablets (150mg) a day on every day of the week I rested on that for quite a while (mostly as I was nervous about going too fast). Then, I did a pretty much similar thing to get down to one tablet a day. Then the same to get to 37.5 mg. I actually stopped pretty abruptly from the 37.5 mg stage, as I felt entirely ready. After that I had about 5 days of feeling pretty crappy, with symptoms as above, then I started getting better. Day 3 with no drugs was the worst for me. So, in the end, it took me about 8 months to go from 225 to nothing. I know that seems an eternity, but I think that is why I coped so well. Five days after dropping from 37.5mg to nothing, I had almost no symptoms. Seven days later I had none. Even if you take nothing else from this, please know that it is possible to get off of this nasty drug BUT you must be careful, listen to your body, do it with support from those around you and in communication with your GP. Good luck to all of you xx :)) :))"

          " Thanks for this Erica!!! Firstly thank you so much for telling your positive story about GB surgery, brilliant. I too have had the same symptoms and am going for surgery as i want my life back, your story is so similar to mine, it has taken me two years to get this far, hundreds of visits to GPs etc only to be told it is IBS, acid reflux etc, my tests eventually have show only 35% function of GB - at last like you I hope for a great result !!! Very best wishes and thank you. <p>Hi I have post op booked this coming Monday and having GB removed June 28th. Very nervous. Pain in right lower rib area be glad to be rid of. Don&#39;t get bad attacks as controlled with diet. Just very nervous of op but know I have to have it. </p><p>I try not to read negative talk need to read more positive stories. </p> <p>I agree that it would be nice to have more success stories so that you would feel better about having your gallbladder removed. It is scary to come here before surgery. But a lot of us aren&#39;t as fortunate to feel better as you think you should after surgery. And it&#39;s nice to have a forum like this for support. I had my surgery over two months ago and as I&#39;m writing you right now I have a terrible stomach ache that is going on on out 22 hours. Pretzels brought it on. I have no problem with fatty foods although I stay away from them now because I&#39;ve started a new diet for weight loss. Can&#39;t eat cereal or oatmeal but fine with wheat bread. Yes it takes some adjusting to what you can&#39;t eat especially when it&#39;s things that others don&#39;t seem to have a problem with. We are all different. </p><p>So I&#39;m so happy for you that you had a successful experience and feel much better as I&#39;m sure many people have. But for those who haven&#39;t they need support.?</p> <p>Positive surgery story for you &#128522;</p><p>I&#39;m 10 days post op from keyhole surgery to remove my gallbladder. I read a lot of posts of negatives after surgery so wanted to say how well mine has gone. </p><p>I was terrified going in as I&#39;ve never had an operation before, but I&#39;m so thankful it&#39;s all done. </p><p>Went into theatre approx 10:30 am and woke up in recovery at 11:20. Did have pain coming around but that was quickly dealt with, thanks to morphine. Taken back to the ward absolutely desperate for a cup of tea, they made me drink water first to make sure I wasn&#39;t sick (I wasn&#39;t) I then had 3 cups of tea and a lovely pack of chicken and mayo sandwiches which I devoured &#128514; I was up and wandering around the ward shortly after my food. </p><p>Obviously there was discomfort but I found no need for any pain medication. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve got a particularly high pain threshold so was very surprised how little pain I was in. Possibly after having such bad gallbladder attacks nothing else quite comes close to that pain. </p><p>I was kept in overnight just so they could monitor my urine as I was drinking more than I was urinating but my bladder slowly came back to life. </p><p>I&#39;ve been home resting ever since, I&#39;m stiff and sore after lying down too long but that soon gets better once up and moving around. My wounds are healing nicely and not causing me much bother apart from I&#39;m worrying about catching them in clothes so I&#39;m loosely covering them when I&#39;m dressed just to make me feel happier. </p><p>I&#39;ve been eating normally, with no bowel issues. I&#39;m still doing pretty low fat as it&#39;s hard to change habits I&#39;ve become used to due to gallbladder attacks but I enjoyed a chicken curry last night with chips, fried rice and prawn crackers (big no no for me before op) and I&#39;ve had no adverse symptoms at all. </p><p>I&#39;ve been for a small walk today which has worn me out a little but it will take time for my body to heal. All in all I&#39;m so over the moon it&#39;s all done and I just need to take it slowly Day by day &#128522;</p><p>Hope I&#39;ve helped put some minds at rest and good luck anyone due for surgery x</p> <p>Hi Erica</p><p>Whilst I&#39;m pleased you are doing well and it&#39;s good to have posts of positive outcomes, not all posts here are negative. </p><p>I and several others who post regularly try to support those who have issues. If I feel I can help someone, I post.</p><p>I have quoted several times that five friends who&#39;ve had their gallbladders out have done well since with no problems.</p><p>There are people trying all sorts of medically unproven remedies and trying to control symptoms with a low fat diet instead of having the surgery they need. I have told my story many times now in order to try and persuade people to have surgery. Once you have a gallstones diagnosis and are getting attacks nothing but surgery will make those gallstones disappear, as you&#39;ve discovered.</p><p>Leaving the stones in there can lead to all sorts of problems.</p><p>Having my cholecystectomy (open surgery) has probably saved my life as they discovered I had early gallbladder cancer and I was able to have a liver resection. Most gallbladder cancers aren&#39;t caught in time. I will have to be monitored for five years, but I&#39;d say my experience has been very positive.</p><p>Like you, I am about three months post op and feeling better than I have in years. I can eat more or less what I like, though fatty foods still scare me. I&#39;ve had practically no diarrhoea. I have been able to come off my meds for high BP, due to having lost 3.5 stones in weight. I still have some uncomfortable tenderness in my right side where my gallbladder was but I did have two major surgeries using the same incision within five weeks. It&#39;s nothing compared to the pain I had which lingered on for 3 or 4 days at a time leaving me exhausted.</p><p></p> <p>I am glad that your surgery was successful. I believe that you went on this site to encourage others, because your experience was positive. &#160;It is good that you listened to your own body and went ahead with the surgery. &#160;</p><p></p><p>There are many, many factors that contribute to a good outcome, such as the health of the patient, the skill of the doctor and surgeon and the ability of the body to recover. &#160;Bellieve it or not, some of the outcome depends on whether one is lucky, or not. &#160;</p><p></p><p>People come to this site to share. &#160;They share practical knowledge, seek comfort and offer support. &#160;Others do have negative experiences, for which medicine is seldom capable of offering a remedy. &#160;These are the patients that the doctors prefer to avoid and prentend don&#39;t exist. &#160;They are the ones who have been told that their very real medical problems are &quot;all in their head.&quot; &#160;</p><p></p><p>I hope that in your life you never experience this. &#160;But you do others who have such an experience by characterizing their posts as negative. &#160;&#160;&#160;</p> Excuse me, I meant to say: But you do others who have such an experience an injustice by characterizing their posts as negative.  <p>Thank you all for your replies. There is a lot of negative on this forum. That doesn&#39;t mean the negative isn&#39;t true. My post says please don&#39;t let the negative scare you out of what could possibly be great! It&#39;s unfortunate that not everyone has the same outcome but its also unfortunate that you don&#39;t see more positive stories on here as well. Can be very discouraging</p> <p>Hi Erica, it&#39;s fantastic to hear your success story. I too know loads of people who have had the op and are leading normal life again. I know there are, I won&#39;t call it negative feedback but it is from people who are scared and worried about their condition and reading stories like yours definately makes a difference. My husband had open surgery due to adhesions from previous car accident ,he had suffered may years discomfort etc.However, he did need second op 5 days later ,and the reason for this I have now found is that the lack of communication between staff. They started to give him food when his bowels had not started working so the food just sat in there and of course caused a blockage. I took him to another hospital where they are doing it correctly and not feeding him until his bowels start to work. If anyone who reads this please remember it is important to have your gallbladder removed if it is causing you a problem, it is a very easy op and you will definately benefit you.</p><p>&#160;</p> <p>Hi Erica. Thank you for sharing! I&#39;ve searched the internet looking for someone with similar symptoms to mine. I also had normal CTs, ultrasounds, labs. Only a polyp that none of the doctors thought would be causing my symptoms, which was mostly that dull pain that was constant, no matter what I ate, or if I even ate at all. Mostly in the epigastric region, but sometimes left or right side. I had an endoscopic ultrasound which showed my pancreas and ducts were fine. But my HIDA scan showed 31%, and after my own doctor wasn&#39;t sure that this would be causing my symptoms, I spoke to a surgeon who was confident it was. I&#39;m now 10 days post op, and my question to you is, how long did it take you to feel normal again? And what were some things you experienced along the way? Can you explain what your recovery was like? I keep reading stories of people who were back to themselves in two days or so, and it&#39;s been making me a little nervous.&#160;</p>"

          "Let me start out by saying [b]DO NOT LISTEN TO ALL OF THESE NEGATIVE POSTS ON HERE![/b] The internet says that Gallbladder surgery is the most [b]COMMON [/b]surgery in todays world and about 700,000 people in the United states have their gallbladder taken out each year. So please do not let a couple of hundred negative posts on the internet scare you away from doing something that could change your life for the better! People who have a positive outcome do not post their results, they are too busy enjoying their life now that they feel better! For 10 years I suffered and I finally hit my breaking point. The Gallbladder surgery was the first surgery I ever had so just like many of you, I was on these websites every chance I got searching for a reason to believe this was my answer and that I was doing the right thing. Unfortunately, all I found were all these horror stories and people with complications. My CT scan, Ultrasound, Labs etc all came back fine. I had no gallstones. My Hida scan was 33%, which as many of you know, can be a tricky number when it comes to a Doctor believing that the gallbladder is the problem. Especially in my case where symptoms were not typical gallbladder symptoms. Pain was not always on the right side, it was mostly in the center above my ribs, my pain was not always after a fatty meal, it was with [b]EVERY [/b]meal. I did not have a ton of heartburn. IBS medications, both prescription and over the counter, natural supplements, food/ingredient elimination\u2026it helped, but only temporarily. But I know my body, and their answers weren\u2019t good enough for me. I finally decided to see a surgeon for a second opinion, and then the option was up to me. It took me 2 months to decide that I was going for it. I read every single article online that you can find that relates to gallbladder removal, and every single post on these forum websites, both good and bad. I am now just about 3 months post op and I feel amazing. Of course you have to watch what you eat now and avoid certain foods, but to be honest, it\u2019s all stuff you\u2019re used to by now if you\u2019ve suffered stomach issues before getting your gallbladder out. My gallbladder was covered in scar tissue when they removed it, with some cholesterolosis. One thing I noticed after the surgery is that the dull horrible pain that I had [b]ALWAYS [/b]felt in my stomach is now gone. When you feel that way for [b]THAT [/b]long, it almost feels weird [b]NOT [/b]to feel like that anymore. But I felt so relieved. I still do. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still have days where I feel a bit bloated and I\u2019m still learning what I\u2019m sensitive to, but it\u2019s a different kind of bloat, and the blah feeling I sometimes get now would not even come close to what I felt before the surgery. I\u2019m all for the questions, so please ask. Just remember that just because you don\u2019t have \u201cclassic gallbladder symptoms\u201d doesn\u2019t mean its not your gallbladder!"

          " THANK YOU Chico, I needed that today!!! That was great Chico. You are a great writer. This will surely give everyone on this forum encouragement. Thanks for the post <p>This is so true, every word of it. I had a recovery that some would call &quot;text book&quot;. But when I chose to have this surgery and experienced the aftermath, my mind switched to a focus totally on getting better. My time frame was to feel a whole lot better in 3 months as a start, so my daily routine was to do what I was told - exercise rest ice elevate and learn to get back to living my new normal. I didn&#39;t dwell on ANYTHING but recovering. Patience, time and determination are the key - thanks Chico for spelling it out for so many </p> Wow Chico! Well written and very encouraging, especially for some of us who despair at times!  Thanks for that Chico , lots to take on board but very well worth it .  thanks Chico. I re-read this today. I needed to! I wish you could hold seminars and away days for us ! although I think you live in USA, so no good for me. Anyway you are a great inspiration and tower of knowledge and strength. People will take a lot from your writings.  <p>Oh my how fantastic was that I feel better already that was an amazing read and so very true I can&#39;t thank you enough and will definitely follow everything you&#39;ve said once again thank you chico </p> <p>Chico can you post the website for post &quot;TKR exercises designed for us by a pro&quot;, I would really appreciate it! Thanks, Dolores</p>"

          "<p>No, not THAT PTSD, although it could apply considering the &quot;trauma&quot; of having your knee replaced is considerable.</p><p></p><p>This is[b] PTSD[/b] of a more positive variety designed especially for not only the &quot;Kneebies&quot; among us but for all TKR patients. As you know by now, I do these posts because I get tired of writing the same words over and over again. There comes a time when I type that one extra character, fall off the cliff and end up in a heap writing another BIG post. So here&#39;s my humble offering on our version of [b]PTSD[/b]:&#160;</p><p></p><p>[b]Patience, Time, Strength, and Determination[/b]</p><p></p><p><em>[b]PATIENCE[/b]</em></p><p></p><p>When we first come home, we&#39;re all faced with the question of how long this pain is going to last and how soon will we be &quot;normal&quot; again. Let&#39;s get the &quot;normal&quot; part out of the way first. You will NEVER be your old &quot;normal&quot; self ever again. You now have a 2+ pound mechanical device implanted in your body. That&#39;s not normal...except for a robot. You will never be able to play competitive sports, do a slalom ski run at 60 mph or even just plain run. Anything involving knee impact or twisting motions is verboten! (<em>Check my other post on acceptable/forbidden activities</em>.) My hip doc told me years ago that I could have a hip that lasted 25 years or go back to playing hockey and having it last only three. Your choice...except that having it done a second time is NEVER as good as the first...never as tight...never as strong.</p><p></p><p>Back to patience. We live in a world where the value of patience is completely discarded as we demand whatever we want NOW! &#160;There&#39;s an old book entitled &quot;The McDonaldization of America&quot; which speaks eloquently to this point. &#160;We want our food fast and healing faster. For us, patience cannot be a virtue...it must be a necessity. We cannot speed up a healing process that takes a long while to complete, no matter what we say, want or wish. &#160;In other words, getting past a TKR is something mostly out of our control. Yes, we can do our PT and exercises without which we&#39;d never get better; but the rest is not something we have any say over. Therefore, patience with the healing process is an absolute requirement for us to get past this. &#160;Just like those car rides with our parents when we were kids (<em>&quot;Daddy, when will we get there?&quot; &#160;&quot;When we get there!&quot;</em>), be more Zen:<em> &quot;I&#39;ll be better when I&#39;m better.&quot; &#160;</em></p><p></p><p><em>[b]TIME[/b]</em></p><p></p><p>Lockstep with patience is time. &#160;If you haven&#39;t noticed already, a TKR recovery is not measured in days or weeks but in many months, up to 18 or more in some cases. (<em>Check my other post on The TKR Bell Curve</em>.) If you think you&#39;ll be on your feet in a day or two, you&#39;re CORRECT! You have to be! &#160;The best thing you can do is walk and exercise. However, if you think you&#39;ll be back to work in a month, you are flat out delusional. What else is there to say? Except for the extreme, rare cases, this is just not going to happen because a TKR recovery takes a lot of time. &#160;At the beginning of mine, I slept an awful lot...actually, unconscious would be a better description. When I asked my GP why I was sleeping so much, she responded:<em> &quot;All the healing energy of your body is being directed to your knee.&quot; &#160;</em></p><p></p><p>Expenditure of energy can lead to exhaustion and sleep. That&#39;s what&#39;s happening to your body too. You have to be prepared to give your body time to heal and recover. &#160;We all know that you cannot push a knee...when you do, it slaps you back by swelling up, getting hot, causing pain, etc. Don&#39;t do that! Listen to your body...do your exercise work but give yourself time to heal. Don&#39;t push to drive again especially if you&#39;re still on opioids (absolute no-no) or don&#39;t have the motion/strength to depress a clutch. Very dangerous. And don&#39;t rush back to work. There&#39;s no way a nurse can run the halls, a construction or factory worker can bend and lift, or even a desk-jockey sit there for eight hours without pain and swelling. &#160;Most people return to work around six months, some faster and a few slower. Give yourself the time to heal before resuming your life.</p><p></p><p><em>[b]STRENGTH[/b]</em></p><p></p><p>This one involves three things, specifically, mind, body and spirit. Regardless of how your body feels, your mind has to be strong. Any depressive thoughts should be dealt with and discarded immediately. Post-Operative Depression is a real thing for people that have body parts replaced. The docs never talk about it so be prepared for those crying jags 10 days post-op. Know what it is and discard it. Any feelings of depression down the road are usually caused by having unrealistic expectations&#160;about your recovery, like <em>&quot;Oh poor me...I should be doing better by this time...&quot;</em>. Bullpucky!!! Just a bunch of Jedi mind tricks you&#39;re playing on yourself. STOP DOING THAT! Focus your mind on the positive; distract it with other things like reading a good book, being with friends or killing zombies on XBox. Strong mind...do it!</p><p></p><p>Your body also needs to be strong. PT only gives you your range of motion back; it does nothing for your atrophied quads, glutes and core. After PT, you MUST do the gym (or home) gym work to regain your physical strength. This is the only way you&#39;re going to climb stairs unaided again or walk without a cane for the rest of your life. If you can&#39;t get to a gym, get a set of resistance bands and use them. Also: Eat healthy, lose weight (if necessary). hydrate a lot, eliminate artificial sweeteners and processed foods, eat good protein. You have to rebuild all the leg and hip muscles that will support your new knee. &#160;</p><p></p><p>To get all this done, you&#39;ll need to look inside yourself and find your peaceful center. It&#39;s the place you need to go when you&#39;re all alone, times are tough and things might not be going as you thought they would. Pray, meditate, practice yoga, read from your favorite spiritual books or other resources. Do whatever you normally do to find some peace in your life. &#160;Concentrate on bringing that healing, spiritual energy into your body. &#160;Do not discount this source of strength...it is very important.</p><p></p><p><em>[b]DETERMINATION[/b]</em></p><p></p><p>This is where you get to kick some serious a$$... This is all about motivation and focus. The hard part is that it all has to come from inside of YOU. Yes, there are great posters, books, t-shirts, coffee mugs and more that can provide inspiration but it really all starts and ends with you. The easy part is Physical Therapy, really. &#160;Do you actually think you&#39;d go back to your surgeon for your six-week alignment check and tell him that you skipped all your therapy sessions? &#160;We all know that&#39;s not going to happen. &#160;You have to break down the scar tissue that&#39;s forming or you&#39;ll never walk correctly again. &#160;That&#39;s a pretty powerful incentive. &#160;It&#39;s what comes AFTER PT that will make all the difference.</p><p></p><p>The only way to get your strength back is by exercising your quads, glutes and core that have atrophied over these past many months. You&#39;ll look down at your leg and see a toothpick where there once was a strong quadriceps muscle. Gotta fix that...and the only way is to get out of your chair and do the work. (<em>See my post on Post-TKR Exercises, designed for us by a pro.</em>) And the only way to get out of your chair is to make the determination that exercise will now be a part of your daily like. I won&#39;t be something you do occasionally or when you &quot;feel like it&quot;...instead, it will be part of your SCHEDULED daily activities. You have to keep your focus on getting stronger and not give into depressive thoughts and actions. See yourself better then MAKE yourself better! &#160;My mentor for my master&#39;s degree had an old IBM punch card on his office corkboard containing five simple words that have guided me since I met him in 1971. &#160;Those words: <em>&quot;NO EXCUSES. DO THE WORK.&quot;</em> &#160;Determine to do the work necessary to get well again...no mind games...do the work!</p><p></p><p><em>[b]CONCLUSION[/b]</em></p><p></p><p>Just my thoughts on a lot of topics and questions that keep getting asked over and over again. Just an old guy musing about the past year trying to recover from what everyone calls the most &quot;brutal&quot; of all surgeries...and I concur. It can be life changing in many ways, not just the physical. You can really find parts of you that you never knew existed or had forgotten about for a long time. Recovering from a TKR is an [b]OPPORTUNITY[/b] to find strengths that you never knew you had and make you a better person for it. Or...you can wimp your way through it...your choice.</p>"

          " Hi Sanddancer, just wondered how you were getting on? I've just found this forum, as I have been told I have 'hemiplegic type' migraine. I don't actually get paralysed, but bad pins and needles/fizzing/electric like pain in my limbs/face, left side, and blow you rhead off pain. It lasts days and takes days to recover, although I seem to have residual symptoms most of the time. I've got almost permanent visual problems, balnce etc. Have had 4 brain mri's, vep's and a lumbar puncture etc to test for ms, I have a pineal cyst too. Any body else out there in similar situation? I feel like I'm going to peices! Hi Sanddancer and bea66, I'm really sorry to hear about both of your migraine attacks and how severe they are. I can empathise with you. I started getting migraines when I was 7 - it was really scary for me and I didn't know what was happening to me (facial paralysis, visual disturbance, sickness, disorientation). Unlike Sanddancer I was really lucky to have a doctor whose wife suffered with hemiplegic migraine and understood what was happening to me. I then began on a course of all different types of medication. Around my mid-teens I started to get cluster migraines and I had to be sedated on several occasions because I was so unwell and couldn't stop being sick. Horrible horrible horrible. I was then sent to a neurologist for a full investigation and was prescribed the highest dosage of beta blockers. They made me put on weight, feel tired and sluggish plus I seemed to have pins and needles constantly because of them. For me this wasn't a long-term solution because I was concerned about the impact of lots of medication on my body. Luckily the clusters subsided until I was studying at uni, but I was in my 2nd year and worried that I wouldn't be able to get my work done if the attacks kept disrupting my work. I sought out a therapist so help me get through it and to see if I could improve things without heavy medication (I'm not suggesting you should do this or advising you do the same I'm just relaying my own story). We did quite a bit of work around the fear of migraine that I had and she helped me to release this. I also learnt about myself and that I am prone to stress and this can trigger an attack for me. Based on this I made sure I had a good diet, plenty of exercise and rest and the result has been that my migraines have got better. The attacks are easier to deal with and far far less frequent. The Migraine Trust have lots of useful information and also a Travelling Migraine Diary which you can fill in to tell other migraine sufferers about your story. They help you to feel less isolated too about being a sufferer as there are 8 million of us in the UK! I hope you guys find ways to manage your migraine better soon. I blog about migraine and how it has affected me, which I have found to be a great outlet. Lenks xx  Hi, I too suffer from this rare condition and have found it hard to find any information or help with it. There is so little guidance or assistance out there. I take tops ax in huge amounts on a daily basis to control mine, but find it leaves me tired and to start with mt body reacted badly, my beautiful long hair fell out!! A year and a half on from my diagnosis I can work, but I have memory loss, and like you a few days out from an attack, I have a terrible headache, I sound drunk, I become clumsy, and can't think. When an attack takes place, I vomit continually for 24 hours, it is so awful, but it passes, and I am left with three days of complete exhaustion. Reading this at least I know there are a few more bodies out there feeling the same as me!! Sunshine xxx Hi sunshine and everyone. This has been a true nightmare. No meds worked for me and they cant decide if i had a tia or not. I woke 3 weeks ago totally numb down lhs and was incoherant. I havnt been right since. Ive had two episodes of sharp needle type pain in my head and numbness which wont go away. I see my gp today . He called me in straight away after a phone appt. I honestly think if there is questions and no firm evidence they dont know what to do and migraine is the easiest way out for them. "

          "i have recently been diagnosed with hemiplegic migraines. as its such a rare condition alot of doctors dont know anything about it , or how to treat this debilitating condition. i am typing this because i hope that it may help someone out there who is going through this and the doctors dont seem to know what is going on with them. my symptoms tend to start two days out from an attack. i usually get a nasty ache at the back of my head , its tends to be dull and very painful, a score of 7-8 is normal. my head will feel like a block of lead, and i become very tired and listless. i tend to do alot of sleeping as well. on the second day my balance starts to go and i stumble about and and i notice my speech gets slightly slirred. the attack usually induces bells palsey to the lhs of my face, my left eye droops as does my mouth. i have swollowing difficulties and loose sensation down the lhs from face through all my limbs. i get paralysis on the lhs in my limbs. i usually cant pass urine so i have to be catheritised, and am nil by mouth. the attacks seem to get worse each time as well , the last time i was taken to hospital in a semi concious state . i usually start to come out of it typically 3 days after the attack and my left arm is the first to fully recover , while my balance and left leg can take 2-3 weeks to come right . that depends on the severity of the attack . i find that i never make a full recovery either , so i am left with short term memory loss and learning difficulties , and am on a soft food diet only. i can only work parttime now as well, my body doesnt like full time hours and i got very washed out. i find 4-5 hours is maximum for me per day any longer and i hit a wall and struggle to go on. the nurologist said that half my brain goes to sleep which causes this. its not curable and they can only try to prevent reoccurance or limit the effects. ive tried propanalol and topomax , but they didnt help at all , so im currently on amitriptaline. the neurologist started a weekly dose 5 weeks ago after an attack beginning with 10mg and increasing it over 5 weeks to 50mg. i had an attack during this time and am now on 75mg. with not much being known about these debilitating migraines im surprised that a nurologist or gp hasnt worked with patients who suffer these migraines and written something for the drs to read as a guide to diagnosis or help prevent them. if any doctor wants to do so them im willing to help with this , to aid anyone else who suffers this rare debilitating migraine."
