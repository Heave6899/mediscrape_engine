          " I have also recently started taking 5 mg of Amlodipine and for the first two weeks didn't experience any side effects. However, I am now feeling like a zombie. I sleep for 12 hours then feel exhausted after just being awake for about 4 hours. It really is debilitating and today I have decided I can't tolerate the side effects any longer so I'm coming off it. I am currently taking Irbersarten but this wasn't bringing my blood pressure down enough so my doctor prescribed Amlodipine as well. Unfortunately I have a low kidney function and it would seem the options as to what I can take are not as good as lots of BP tablets have a detrimental effect on kidneys and also high blood pressure can cause kidney disease so I just hope my GB can come up with another suitable alternative. Would rather have high blood pressure than carry on with this horrible drug. Hi Nigel Just read your experience, mine is very similar, although I went from years on Lisinopril 40mg to this year 20mg PLUS Amlodipine 5mg. All went well for a while (3-4 months) then it crept up on me, I thought I was at the beginning of senile decay/dementer or even alzhermers (excuse spelling, forget how to spell it). I decided last weekend to stop the Amlodipine which did have an immediate impact for the better however I think I have been left with of the residues of it and I thought I would give the Am. another go. Now two days of it and I'm definately back to similar situation as yourself. Did visit the quack but no joy or advice as to the side effects we are having (wonder why?) so have decided to pack the Am. in. One other big draw back I have maybe due to the Lisinopril is lack of sleep or unable to get to sleep but when I do its nearly time to get up so at best I may catch 2-3-4 hours interupted sleep. This I feel adds to the increase in BP - so why do we bother. Anyway I am glad that I have read your report but sorry that you have been through the mill with the side effects. Have noticed from other peoples experiences we are not alone and the drug is banned in Holland - well at least we know why. Hope you get back to normal and find a better way to control your BP., take care. I took 10mg of Amolodipine for two months, after which I went from being able to run 15-20 miles per week, to walking after only 1-2 miles with severe calf cramps. After stopping using the drug for 1 week I was back to my usual fitness. I would never take this drug again. Yes Nigel very similar experience of forgetfulness, dizzyness and mistakes at work.Also paranoid because everyone was critical of practically all i was saying and doing,eventually lost job which ironically was a nurse. paul c. :cry: been on it for almost five years - have basically lost the last five years - sleep problems - cant sleep then can sleep but not for long its a nightmare - decided to look it up and i see folk have had similar problems - think i am gonna just stop it - cant live like this any more - cant function properly - like i said have lost years and i am only 38 AND i cant get that time back with my daughter - been an excuse for a mum for years and the depression ooo thats another story - basicaly had enough - stopping it now - zombie no more It looks like I've been in the same boat as the other people on this drug. I was put on amlodipine 5mg by my GP for medium hypertension. It only lasted a week before I came off it. It gradually seemed to be poisoning me, with the effects getting worse each day. Dull, zombie-like during the day, extreme fatigue during the evening, insomnia at night. I cant remember what I did at work during the 4th and 5th days on it. On the 6th day, I felt I was ready for a nursing home (at 54 that's usually a bit premature, I think). Blurred vision was getting severe. On the 7th day, my memory was so bad that I couldn't remember who the medicine was for - me or my wife! As my vision was so blurred, I couldn't read the pharmacy label on the box. I guessed it probably wasn't my medicine, especially since I couldn't remember when it arrived in the house, so I didn't take it. By the next day, I was starting to come round, and realised what had happened, so I decided not to take it any more. I'm now in my third week off it, and the mood swings are gradually getting less extreme. Hopefully, a few more weeks will get me back to normal. My GP was surprised at the severity of these symptoms, said he was sorry it had given me such a bad experience, and prescribed me some ramipril instead. When I found this site, I realised I wasn't the only person to be messed up by amlodipine. Ramipril seems like a similar disaster waiting to happen, and I don't feel like being an experimental animal again, so I think its time to get to work on changing my lifestyle instead of my prescription! What's the point of fixing my blood pressure with drugs if I end up as a useless zombie?! Hi! My name is val 22 y/o. I went to the quack yesterday because I felt numb. he gave me the AM 10mg. on my first time of taking it . I felt like a sledgehammer hit my head. so I went online to research and after what I discovered, I am Trashing these tablets. I have had dreadful side effects whilst taking this tablet, depression, weight gain, swelling from the knees down to feet, as I have osteo arthritus in my knees, the swelling actually made it worse. Muscle aches. Severe tiredness. After seeing the first doctor, he prescribed a water tablet. This did not work so I went back and saw another doctor and he sent me for blood tests, things still did not improve so I went back and saw another doctor, he told me to stop taking this tablet. Within 3 days of stopping this tablet I had no more swelling, felt happy, more energy, my knees felt loads better. All in all I felt well after 5 months of feeling crap."

          "I am a healthy 58 yr old and normally very active. BP was rising over the last year or so to 178/98 and so this Jan my Doc put me on Amlodipine 5mg. Thats when it started. Firstly with a loss of energy, then total loss of stamina, I felt like a Zombie all the time. As the month progressed I started to get forgetful, dizzy spells, very tingly left hand and painful joints all througfh my left side. BP did not drop as fast as hoped so Doc added Lisinopril 2.5mg. Hey... off with the faries now! After two weeks I could not concentrate on anything people were telling me and to the point that I was becoming detached from the real world. And that was only after a couple of weeks on the cocktail. I decided to trial which drug was causing this and first removed the Lisinopril for a few days then swapped over to stopping Amlodipine. Cor.. what a difference. Almost the next day after stopping Amlodipine I started to recover. After just one week people at work are now saying 'welcome back' and I know what they mean. BP not down yet but I am never going near Amlodipine again, its a wrecker! Has anyone else had anything like my reaction?"

There are some studies of ulcer patients cured after taking 1 cup of cabbage juice 4-5 times a day for 7 to 10 days. I had the courage to do one day 3 x 1 cup, and two days 2 x 1 cups, and my stomach pain disappeared completely with it (I was already doing better before I started). It is very unpleasant and one feels overall bad with it, moreover it causes gas, bad breath, slight headache. It interferes with the thyroid as well. But it works very well for the stomach. I mix the cabbage juice with carrot juice to make it more tasty, sometimes with celery, spinach and fennel as well.</p><p> Water Ph 8.8.

          "<p>When I got diagnosed with mild gastritis (but no H. Pylori) and esophagitis, I looked all over the internet to find what to do. I did not find many accounts of people who have cured themselves successfully and how they did it. So I thought I would write my story once I am cured. Here it is. If you have cured yourself from gastritis too, please share your experience below as well.</p><p></p><p>Many people ask how long it takes to be cured. At first I started on dexilant for a month but I did not see any improvement. After a month I kept taking dexilant and I started the low acid diet in parallel. I got much better in 2-3 days. After two months on dexilant and one month on the diet, I felt completely good. Then I stopped the dexilant cold turkey and got a lot of pain and acidity back in my stomach. Now I regret I did not take the dexilant a little longer as my stomach was obviously not healed and not strong enough to go through the rebound effect of stopping dexilant. I regret also that I did not stop dexilant slowly taking it every other day for a week, then every three days for a week, .... I felt anxious about taking a medication that has so many side effects taken long term and I wanted to stop immediately, which was not reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Anyway there I was back at the beginning with stomach pain and acidity day and night. I felt pain related to the esophagitis as well which really scared me. I hesitated to take dexilant again but I decided to try to cure myself the natural way. Below I describe what I did. I got cured in approximately two months, getting slowly better week by week. After two months of natural cures I had no stomach pain anymore and no excess acid, I was able to sleep again, felt like a new healthy (and lighter -- I lost a few pounds) person. However after those two months, I felt that I needed to follow the diet another month for my stomach to get strong and be able to handle a less strict diet.</p><p></p><p>[b]THE CURE[/b]</p><p></p><p>[b]Books[/b]</p><p></p><p>Most of what I did is summarized in two books which I found very useful:</p><p></p><p>The first book is &quot;Dropping acid: the reflux diet cookbook &amp; cure&quot; by Jamie Koufman. This is the book I based my diet on. The only disagreements I have with the author regard dairy products that I stopped taking as they make the stomach produce more acid (very clear for me), and the use of ginger, manukka honey and aloe vera which I find too irritating and/or acidic (and I don&#39;t feel that they help). Also she does not talk about salt which is known to be irritating for the stomach lining in excess, I felt an improvement when I lowered my intake in salt. I will explain the diet more in details below.</p><p></p><p>The other book is &quot;Ulcer free! Nature&#39;s safe &amp; effective remedy for ulcers&quot; by G. Halpern. I know you may have gastritis and no ulcers but the two conditions are related and what cures one usually cures the other too. I used some of the natural supplements recommended in this book. In particular slippery elm (this one is actually not mentioned in the book) and DGL licorice for stomach pain (coat the interior of the stomach lining), Zinc-Carnosine (reduce inflammation and protects stomach lining - I felt a great improvement after starting to take it especially with acid production at night), and cabbage juice (finished my recovery with this one, after two days I had no stomach pain anymore at night). I describe the supplements more below.</p><p></p><p>[b]What did not work for me[/b]</p><p></p><p>Mastic gum hurts my stomach. It is supposedly helpful against H. Pylori which I knew I did not have (I had been tested).</p><p>Prelief removes the acid in food and stomach very efficiently but causes constipation.</p><p>Tums works well for 45 minutes but then there is a rebound effect with the stomach producing more acid.</p><p>Manukka honey hurts my stomach (Too acidic, Ph level 4, but maybe also because of the tea tree essential oil in it). It is supposedly helpful against H. Pylori.</p><p>Aloe Vera is too acidic (around Ph level 4), and I don&#39;t feel it is doing anything positive.</p><p>Ginger is irritating and I don&#39;t feel it is doing anything positive.</p><p>Probiotics helps with digestion but not really for the stomach.</p><p>Zantac works very well at removing the acidity but makes me feel dizzy and incredibly tired.</p><p>PPI worked very well at removing the acidity and pain in my stomach while I was taking it while doing the diet, but I had a bad rebound effect when I stopped (one must stop slowly by taking it every other day for a while). Also having too low acid in the stomach because of PPI might cause problems in the long term (problems with Calcium and B12 absorption, bacterial infection more likely).</p><p></p><p></p>"

          " I had been taking Cit 20 for just over 8 months and then on to the lower dosage of 10mg In Jan. Actually stopped taking Cit towards the end of May and then a few weeks later noticed I was getting a little short tempered with various things. Don't know if this was due to a lack of sleep. Then last week I started getting tearful. Went to my GP and explained what was going on. I am now back on Cit 10mg. for a few months. I had wondered if stopping the Cit 10 all of a sudden started the tears and short tempers, but the GP said I had done the right thing as the 10mg is the lowest of dosages. Before I started Cit 10 the first time round, the GP told me if I was to take Cit 20 every other day I would probably feel worse as that would give me an \"up\" one day and \"down\" the next. Hence going on to the lower dose. Do you think that could that be happening to you by what you said in your message about \"coming off it properly\". It may be an good idea to have a talk with you doctor as soon as possible. Remember you are not alone!! Good luck and take care x "

          "I've been on 20mg citalopram now for just over a year. I decided to come off about 3 weeks ago as I had started to feel so much better, which I put down to a combination of counselling and the drug which really did do wonders for my depression. I actually hadn't realised quite how bad it was till I started taking citalopram and I felt normal! I've come off it properly, one every 2 days, then half every 2, then quarter every 2/3 days. The whole process took about 3/4 months. Now I'm on nothing. The physical withdrawl hasn't been too bad. I've been dizzy and kinda sick for the first week or so and that's starting to go now. However I've been feeling awful emotionally. I feel just as bad as I did before I started the medication, worse even! I feel incompetent at my job and I've even started wondering if it's right for me, I'm a teacher and I've always loved my job. I'm becoming paranoid about my relationship and tearful at the slightest thing. I feel very depressed and unstable if that makes sense. I almost feel suicidal. Is this normal?? I really need some reassurance that I won't need to be on this for the rest of my life. :("

          " Hi, I hope this will help, as I was very interested to hear your case. I started with a fever of 38'C about 3 1/2 weeks ago, with no cough but a horrible headache and aches and pains and severe lethargy. I immediately isolated in the spare room as my son may be at risk. The headache soon went, but the temperature would come and go, and I was still really tired and unable to do much. After two weeks I spoke to the doctor, who said to stick it out for another week. I then got worse, much more tired and tightness and pain in my chest, but still breathing OK. Temperature was almost constantly at 38. Finally I've been prescribed antibiotics, and the temperature is still around but not constant. This time the Dr said that he didn't think it was Coronavirus as it doesn't go on this long with a temperature. I'm usually quite fit and active, not overweight and no underlying health issues. Like you I am tearing my hair out and no idea what is going on, or when I'm going to recover.  Res and Julie, yours are the first first-hand stories I've heard, interesting that you have similar descriptions. I do not have anything specific to add. But some questions. First, if you can give some idea of your location? Second, are there any nutritional questions the doctors ask? What are you eating now? For that matter, what was your diet like before, and were you taking any vitamins and supplements? Of course zinc has been talked about a lot in regards to the virus. Thanks, and best wishes for you both - and for all in these times. Hi Res I'm on week two now. I have little to no cough, no raised temperature, just constant breathlessness. I've been pretty much bed-bound for these past two weeks. Having said this my condition has been up and down as you describe, I even went back to work for 3 days only for it to hit back yet again. Unlike you though, my sleep has been mostly unaffected, although it is challenging to calm down enough to fall to sleep initially. Saying that, keeping my anxiety levels down while suffering from this breathlessness is a bloody challenge. Like you, I have no underlying health conditions, however I'm mid-20s and am usually fit and healthy. As a result when I eventually went to hospital I was kept for an hour, had my vitals measured and sent home. I can't argue with the decision as I could still talk (although it is challenging to do so) and walk myself out - like yourself I'm getting pretty desperate... I do hope I haven't another two weeks of this! To clarify, I too feel slightly better every so often, even on my worst days, but it soon becomes a challenge to breathe again. As well as this I seem to improve every few days, enough to feel my breathing almost back to normal, only for it to return with bad as ever. Hope you get well soon. "

          "Hi, I've had Covid19 for 4 weeks and if I had the energy I'd be tearing my hair out. I've had 2 sets of prohylactic antibiotics to safeguard against bacterial infections, my temperature has been up and down but never higher than 38 the entire illness. I've had severe neuropathy during the illness and some kind of night seizures accompanying the other more well publicised symptoms that mean my sleep is terrible also. I went to hospital Day 14 after a week of seriously thinking I'm on death's door and my blood oxygen was good enough to be sent home for follow up at the Covid Hubs where they basically just take temperature, pulse and oxygen levels. I was prescribed a 2nd course of antibiotics there as my temperature was still up and they are checking in on me every few days. Meanwhile I am having one better day, then another terrible day, then a better day then a worse day..But 'better' is still bed ridden, just means I can breath well enough and not too dizzy to make myself my own cup of tea, have a shower and engage in some small talk with my family. Everytime I have a good few hours I think, that must be me getting well now, but no, 4 weeks later and the last 24 hrs my breathlessness has been worse than it was for the previous 5 days..Am about ready to shoot myself. Is there anyone else that's experienced being so ill with this virus outside of an ICU setting where it's carried on this long? Even ICU patients are recovering in 3-6weeks . Cannot understand why I'm not getting well yet. I have no underlying health issues and I'm in my 30s. I don't know if I still have Covid or if this is post viral inflammation and fatigue..There is no way of knowing as they are not testing community cases. Every doctor just says it's definitely Covid but I have no idea if I've passed the peak of the illness or if i should still be worried it could get worse. Just feel it's going on forever. Be great to know if there's any non hospital stories of people being sick, as in still unable to do a thing this length of time. Thanks!"

          " Just want to say congratulations, and thanks for the advice x Thank you :) I think it's important to share good news and tips as well as the bad. x It's great to hear that your are of the meds and doing great :). I wish I had come across this before. I have gone completely to zero after a year of taking the meds. I am having the most horrendous withdrawals, that I don't know if to go back on them or continue. I am so scared :( Hi Evyivy, I am so sorry to hear that you're having bad withdrawal symptoms. I know from earlier on that when I tried to reduce my effexor too soon my symptoms were quite nasty - I would not wish that on anyone. Do you mind if I ask how long you have been taking no medication, what dose you decreased from and how rapidly? I really think that your withdrawal symptoms will pass completely if you taper slowly enough. From what I understand taking things slowly is key. Also, if it provides any hope, after about 1.5 to 2 months post effexor I feel great and have had no ongoing side effects. Importantly, do you have a supportive GP who knows about what you're going through? It is always good to check in with them for emotinal and physical support. Perhaps he/she can also help treat some of the side effects (eg with anti-nausea meds). If you have any questions about my experience, I will be happy to let you know. Best of luck - I really hope thngs get better for you soon. xx PS. I was also wondering if anyone has had any luck reducing their weight post-effexor. My weight will not budge, despite diet control and exercise. Any news of positive results would be so wonderful.  hi I am back, sorry for no replying sooner. Thank you, thank you, thank you for your advice. I haven't been able to reply sooner as I became very ill. Going cold turkey from these meds is not a good idea. Although I feel proud of myself as I am now off the meds, it was a very dangerous thing to and I went to hell and back. I am still suffering the withdrawals, today has been particularly bad with the dizzy spells, unsteady vision and brain zaps. I think I was feeling better and then tried to catch up on everything! ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU XXX Hi Evyivy, I'm so glad to hear that things are going better for you! It can be such a scary time, but you will get through it! Good luck with everything- I'll be thinking of you, as I'm sure many others will be! xx G'day Oz82 Your wisdom comes from experience ... and I am so glad when I Googled Venlafaxine withdrawal this morning I clicked on this thread. I have been feeling quite wretched and the strength and support offered by your words came shining through to me. I reached a point a two or three weeks ago when I thought not only was Venlafaxine not controlling my fibromyalgia pains and stress but my body, especially digestive system, was reacting to the point that I wanted to stop it immediately ... which I did. I mentioned it to nobody but know now that the side-effects are a lot to handle on your own. I know the way to go is forwards but have taken from your words some courage to perhaps share some of this burden. Thank you.  Hi - firstly, thank you so much for sharing this! I have been on 225 mg (capsules) per day for the past 8 years. I am now 26 and looking to reduce my dose slowly to come off permanently. Two weeks ago I reduced my dose by 37.5 mg to 187.5 mg per day, and haven't really noticed any side effects until a few days ago when I noticed I was feeling incredibly tired, had a strong headache (very unusual for me) and was very short and irritable with people. Have had no nausea - if anything my appetite has increased! My weight has remained steady throughout my time taking Effexor, and has always been on the low end (BMI = 19.5). My plan is to continue taking 187.5 for the next 2.5 months - I don't think there's anything wrong with taking things slowly and being careful. After all, if you've been on Effexor this long - what's another year to come off it? I have also tried to come off in the past by reducing 37.5 mg per month - had to go back to regular dose once I hit 150 mg. Will try to remember to update later down the track.  I couldn't agree more with oz82. I just came off Effexor 300 mg daily (4 x 75 mg) after 6 years. I tried twice but went way too fast. First time I ended up so badly depressed I could not get out of bed nor eat for almost 2 weeks. But for my boyfriend at the time I don't know what would have happened. Second time I went still a bit too fast and had to swing to a halt at 150 mg due to withdrawal symptoms. I then tapered down to 75 mg with moderate to severe symptoms but hung in there until I stabilized. Then I dropped down to 37.5 mg which was a breeze compared to the 75 mg drops. I waited again until stabilized and then dropped the last 37.5 mg. I have to honestly say, I have a very high tolerance for pain and discomfort but withdrawing from Effexor is not for the faint hearted. The best advice is go slow, slow and slow. I just want to congratulate you. What you have done is commendable and as I know from experience a hard thing to do. I too was on venlafaxine xr 225mg for 8 years. The reasons I was put on it was because of a situation that caused depression, panic attacks which led to seizures and it replaced other medications that I had been on for almost 30 years for the same reason. I have tried to wean off of it twice before but with no help from my gp. I was diagionised with Afib last summer and the cardiologist wanted me off as the venlafaxine was working against my heart medications. Still my gp would not help. I was referred to a Psychiatrist who, thank goodness, agreed with my cardiologist. I started weaning last October 37 1/2 every time the side effects cleared up from the last weaning. I took my last pill the third week of February and although I still have some side effects have had no depression, panic attacks or seizures. I am sure the other side effects will disappear eventually. When I saw my gp for other reasons last week and told him I was off the venlafaxine what did he do but offer me more. Sometimes you just have to wonder."

          "Hi guys, After 6 long years on venlafaxine, I have finally gotten off the drug. I don't know if this will be of any use to anyone, but I wanted to share some hopeful words and tips for anyone trying to come off of this nasty medication. I should clarify, however, that I am not angry for having been put on this medication, as I am sure it saved my life. That being said, 6 years, 225mg/day and an additional 20kg later (!!! just awful !!!) I am so glad to be Effexor free. The details: I was taking Effexor XR and had been on my maximum dose for 3.5 years. Prior to that I was on 150mg for about 2 years. I took 3 x 75mg capsules every morning as a once a day dose. Taking three tablets was initially to save money (for some reason it was cheaper here in Australia to do it that way) but it ended up having the extra bonus of making withdrawal easier. What worked for me may not work for everyone, but this is the approach my GP and I came up with. Most was my own plan, based on what I found worked, but my GP gave me the initial \"tablet dropping\" idea and trusted me to take it slowly, listen to my body and see her as needed. It worked very, very well, with minimal side effects. If it helps even one of you it will be worth having posted this. First things first: 1. Make sure you are taking care of yourself and are in a good place emotionally before even contemplating withdrawal. 2. You are going to need supportive people around you- I don't know if I could have done it without my boyfriend. Tell your family/friends AND DOCTOR what you are doing. This is crucial. You may also want to tell someone you trust at work what is going on, so they know why you may seem a little dazed every so often. 3. Make sure you are eating really well. I switched to a vegan diet about half way through and, although this is not for everyone, this made withdrawal so much easier. I am sure the huge amounts of vegetables made a difference. I especially noticed that days when I ate lots of sea vegetables I coped best with symptoms, so consider working them into your normal diet. 4. Take a multivitamin and drink lots of water. At least 2 litres a day. This will help minimise the horrible nausea you will probably experience. 5. Drink ginger tea/use ginger. This is also for the nausea and I found it was essential in the days after stopping completely. It really does help. I also wondered if some people might find a prescription for maxalon or stemetil helpful, as the nausea and dizziness was the worst for me. 6. Get lots of sleep. I mean heaps of it. Anyone who has withdrawn from this med (or even skipped a dose!) knows how tired you will get. Now the tablet reduction: I started by reducing my total weekly dose by 1 tablet per week (taking 2 tabs one day and 3 every other day) for a few weeks. This sounds like nothing, but even this produced quite bad side effects at first (teariness, exhaustion, dizziness and nausea). Only when I was comfortable (ie no side effects) with this dose regimen did I move on. Then, I took 2 tabs instead of 3 on two days a week for a few weeks until I was comfortable (making sure to space the 2 tablet days out, eg Sat and Wed). Then I got into the habit of taking tablets as follows. I made sure to plan/write all of this down on our calender beforehand, to use as a guide and make sure I didn't mess it up: 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2 etc for about 3 to 4 weeks Then: 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2 etc for about another 3 weeks to month. Then: 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, etc for about a month. Then when I got to 2 tablets (150mg) a day on every day of the week I rested on that for quite a while (mostly as I was nervous about going too fast). Then, I did a pretty much similar thing to get down to one tablet a day. Then the same to get to 37.5 mg. I actually stopped pretty abruptly from the 37.5 mg stage, as I felt entirely ready. After that I had about 5 days of feeling pretty crappy, with symptoms as above, then I started getting better. Day 3 with no drugs was the worst for me. So, in the end, it took me about 8 months to go from 225 to nothing. I know that seems an eternity, but I think that is why I coped so well. Five days after dropping from 37.5mg to nothing, I had almost no symptoms. Seven days later I had none. Even if you take nothing else from this, please know that it is possible to get off of this nasty drug BUT you must be careful, listen to your body, do it with support from those around you and in communication with your GP. Good luck to all of you xx :)) :))"

          " This is awesome news and a very helpful post to me, Georgina. Thank you. I was told the same things and, though a bit earlier in the process than you (surgery 5 weeks ago), I am still suffering from gas, pain, bloating and general discomfort. Good luck with your continued recovery.---Phil  Hi Georgina I could have written your post myself. I too had mine removed 4 months ago and have been vomiting, Have the most horrendous,nausea fatigue dizziness And diarrhea sometimes too. I have been in and out of hospital having one test after another. Eventually saw the top gi doc here in Ireland who told me he had seen this before and that it was very rare but that it would settle down in time. My surgeon had never seen this before. My gp is a fantastic support as she he seen this before with a patient who did recover after 6 months. I have since heard of others who have also gone through this who had the symptoms anywhere from 3 to 8 months. I am delighted that you posted this as I have posted before and no one has replied with the same symptoms. I had 1 large stone causing me pain but my gallbladder was normal. If I could turn back time I would gladly have my gallbladder back with the stone as I feel I will never be normal again. I've gone from a confident bubbly person to a nervous wreck who cries nearly every day over this. The only good thing is I haven't vomited in a 2 weeks so am hoping that things are improving. It's a living nightmare. The people that have gone through this told me it gradually got better slowly. I am taking caltrate calcium 600 d 1 3 times a day with food for the diarrhea and also psyllium husk capsules. The doctors put me on questran but it made me worse. I hope this post is of some comfort to you that you are not alone going through this.  Hi i had no problems but the GP that referred me did tell me that a percentage of people do suffer after surgery with the symptoms you listed. He said some do and some don't and he couldn't guarantee I wouldn't... So I was relieved I was in the non reaction group.. But well aware . although I have never felt better since my op. I have read up that we ( gallbladder less individuals) are prone now to fatty liver something I have not been told by a health professional .. so one year after op I am eating low fat healthy. If I eat fat I have a constant ache in liver.. i hope it won't be long till your liver settles down and adjusts ... yours sally  It beats me why we are not put into the picture fully BEFORE our gallbladders are removed. I'm still recovering - my op was on the 8th April. I've been sick, dizzy and very low on energy - my brain wants to do stuff, but my body isn't willing. The only fat I would now consider using is raw virgin coconut oil and I'm still very very careful with my diet. This last day or so I've felt a flutter of energy return to me, although yesterday I \"mis-used\" it and had to rest up for the remainder of the day making me feel angry and frustrated with myself for being so stupid. I'm just grateful we are having some sunshine of late - it helps with my recovery. Do you take anythink like Omeprazole Georgina? That might help with the reflux issue. Like you I get diarrhea sometimes; I was told to take something like immodium. Best wishes to you. Well unfortunately I am one of the 10% of people who have their GB removed and who suffer from BAM Bile Acid Malabsorption I have been like this for three years and each doctor or surgeon have said the same thing \"oh well your just unlucky\" I started off taking codeine and lomotil to stop the D nothing worked I now take Colesevelam I started on one a day its now one up to two a day they do control it a little but I still get flare ups and I have to take Imodium. I was told nothing about this before the op I am going for yet another Colonoscopy to find out why I have pain they think it might be a stray stone  Hi Georgina, I had my gallbladder removed 5 months ago now, I also have IBS and Fibromyalgia, did not really want it doing but I had no choice as it was full of stones and had a few bad bouts of pain and was to,ld by the surgeons that it could errupt, a friend of mine died from this a few years ago. I have had the bloated ness and still do and some colic pain and nerve pain on the stomach to the groin, I was told that this is a meridian nerve that takes up to 6months to get better, it is a struggle and I am tired allot but with having the other two complaints they can be really bad as well, unfortunately I tend to eat the wrong things sometimes, a good main diet, but also some cake and a bit of chocolate and that I feel, especially the cake makes me more bloated, I have had a few boats of diarrea but not too bad, it take time and I am 60, anybody that thinks an operation, you are better in a few weeks are not real, there is also scar tissue from the operation which one will get some pain from, that in itself takes a while to heal, but we just have to take one day a time and think that at least we are not going to have the gallbladder bust, as its not there, its been a struggle for me, and I have to do the housework as well, fortunately I work from home part-time and I can work when I want, but its not easy at all, its good that we can discuss each others syptoms on this page, and know some other people suffer the same, take care Stella I just had my gallbladder removed on Thursday march 10,2016.. Right out of surgery i woke up10 minutes after and stayed awake for hours with anxiety..hot..out of it..hard to breath... Its now9 days after my surgery and i feel aweful. Extremely dizzy.. Light headed.. Fatigue.. Nausea.. Feeling of being surreal.. Headaches..hot flashes.. Im only 34 yrs old. I went to er..went to my surgeon.. They said in time itll go away..that maybe the anesthesia is still in me. ?.. Im constantly dizzy. Ill feeling. I don't feel normal. I want to be out of bed and do normal things. I was fine before this surgery.. I cry everyday. I can't work Im afraid i will lose my job. Please someone help. Advice? I don't know what to do but just pray. Cry. Lay here. I tried standing just to shower or brush my teeth and i feel like i will faint. Or real weak. Anybody feel like this? <p>11 days post op so early days. Have healed well apart from a large dent in my side which I&#39;m going to get checked. I really do wish I had been given more info for post op as I can&#39;t eat much and have shocking dioreeah sorry tmi and spelt wrong. I&#39;ve just finished mat leave back to work soon but don&#39;t think I can chance it</p> <p>I&#39;m 10 months post lap coli. I&#39;m in more pain now I&#39;ve had my gallbladder removed. It&#39;s so hard to cope with constant pain. Plus being sick and having loose stools. Surely this can&#39;t be normal?? Claire </p> I had mine out on Monday 9-19-2016. Today is my 3rd day home. I feel horrible. I have had a headache and dizzy since Monday. It hurts to hold my head up. I have called the dr and she just says to take ipbrouen. I have no appetite. All I do is sleep. No one said I would possibly have this. "

          "Hi lovely fellow gallbladder buddies :) I underwent an emergancy Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy around four months ago; I had a giant gallstone blocking a bile duct, was in unbelievable pain and went from being put on a waiting list of about 6 months to laying on a hopital bed about to be put under, just one short night after a pain episode. It wasn't life threatening, but it was life changing... Never had surgery before and was told I would be \"better in one week\" that i'd feel \"amazing\" and \"brand new, even better than before!\" So as probably most of you are experiencing- Being someone who hasn't ever hated anoter person, after two months off from work due to post op issues, I was ready to hobble back into the hospital and punch every nurse, doctor and surgeon that had spoken or even smiled at me before. I had seen SO many doctors and gone back and spoken with the surgeons at my hosptial and have been lead through so many hoops. My post op problems include: 1. Vomiting/nausia after eating (anything, including salads sometimes) 2. Acid reflux (sharp pains in my chest- Middle and sides) 3. Bloating after every meal to at least one dress size larger. 4. Diarrhea 5. Extremely debilitating dizzyness/ fatigue 6. Headaches behind the eyes And lastly 7. Rashes Yesterday I found a new doctor that for the first time confirmed something that I was made to believe I was crazy for thinking--- !!!!THIS IS NORMAL!!!! This is what he told me- \"Everytime I refer one of my patients to get a Cholecystectomy, I warn them that the following 6 months of their life will be the hardest.. but it DOES get better. You liver slowly learns how to produce and control bile and you begin to be able to slowly bring less bland meals with more healthy fats into your diet. Until then, taking digestive enzimes and getting plenty of excersise is your best bet\" I hope this gives you all some sort of relief and a bit of hope. Reguardless of the changes, I'm still glad to have gotten it removed. I just wish someone had have told me this from the beginning. <3"

          " Natural sources of Vitamin D animal-based, including fish and fish oils, egg yolks, cheese, fortified milk, and beef liver. Vitamin D deficiency can even cause cancer. You must focus on your diet. Focus on vitamin D rich foods, try to take advantage of sunlight atleast 20 mins a day. Reha also gave a very good advice. Must follow that.  Vitamin D deficiency is caused by a lot of conditions, not just cancer. Vitamin D is the only vitamin that we should be able to make naturally. When we are not producing enough, it generally is not because of a shortage on our part, it is because there is something wrong with our body. If you take more vitamin D and you still have symptoms, check for other conditions such as auto-immune disease or cancer.Vitamin D deficiency is also common among people of African descent. I hope this helps! Hi Helen - just reading thru this further to our chat in the other discussion - interestingly I am also on naproxen for osteoarthritis, as i mention over there on the other thread - bbut I also have hypothyroidism (due to my lithium) and so many of your symptoms sounds lilke thyroid! The prob with that is, many doctors see a normal test result and assume yr thyroid is OK but what a normal result is can vary from peron to person and some people need an additional boost of T3 to help them process thyroxine... Theres a lot of controversy about thyroid at the moment there seems a real issue of underdiagnosis and undertreatment. Go back tp GP and ask for thyroid to be retested, in the meantime read up on test results - what results are normal range, becasue..... Hypothyroidism is a cause of vitamin D deficiency! Hi, I know this is a old post but if you do see it was wondering if you are feeling any better, I have just been diagnosed with low Vitamin D and have been put on a Suppliment and can't wait to see if it's the answer to so many health issues. Thanks."

          "I've been unwell for on and off now for almost a year. I remember phoning off sick a couple of times before feeling tired and 'achy'. I thought I was just being lazy and this was psychosomatic. Then I started getting really ill when I developed a sudden onset of neck/shoulder pain which is still an on going problem now although the pain has turned into discomfort/ache which I have learned to manage doing exercise and stretches. I also feel sensitivity on other parts of my body (like invisible bruises.For 6 months I was coping with my neck/shoulder problem (symptoms are crawling/tingling sensation in the arm, sensitivity to touch like its bruised and cold feeling and dull ache on my shoulder blade). Then gradually I started developing 'flu like symptoms' without cough or cold but with tiredness/fatigue and dizzy headache which are intermittent throughout the day, until 2 weeks later I started getting throbbing ache in my legs and eventually I couldn't sit all day without getting restless legs and crawling/tingling sensation in my legs which caused weakness in my legs and worse when I'm going upstairs - and my knees keeps clicking. I went to my doctors who prescribed me with naproxen. And told me that I had something called Reactive Arthritis, which i thought was a misdiagnosis. Overall I though that it could be viral related This time I've been off work for a week when I started to feel better after a week on naproxen. I came back to work for a week feeling like i thought I recovered. Then boom 2 weeks later gradually the flu like symptom came back with extreme tiredness / fatigue and I've been in bed since. I'm still achy all the time regardless. I have no energy to do anything, even showering is a struggle. Ive been in bed most of the time, sometimes I try to go out with my husband for a few hours but I come back home absolutely exhausted and the soreness/headache i get is a different level. Most of the time I feel like my body is inflamed. So i decided to get a second opinion and i went to see another GP who referred me for a blood test. A few days later, my results came through and I have Vitamin D deficiency. Everything else they tested seem fine.I have a better outlook now though after the diagnosis, apparently it will take months for the treatment to take effect. I guess now they found something they will stop investigating further (which worries me a little bit) but i guess its process of elimination so treat one thing at a time. Would be great to hear from others who also has this deficiency and whether the treatment was effective?"
