I have anxiety and I believe sometimes we get pains here and there just for no apparent reason and eventually they go. </p><p>The body works hard each day so it&#39;s just normal.</p><p>And worry can bring on pains </p> <p>Dear Brite </p><p></p><p>I can relate to all you described and said above, every single bit. Sometimes I have pains 7 days a week non stop. And they are so real that they can knock me out literally. Like I become breathless while exercising, lose all energy feel dizzy and about to faint. I need to sit and breather deep. And everything I think yes, finally I defeat it, it comes back. I take 4 types of medications and they help somehow. But I&#39;m working hard to let my brains finally understand I&#39;m not in danger. I have great days, I mean painless, carefree happy followed by well you know, the days you feel scared to death and feeling crap. But I want you to know that it does get better. For me it really helps to remember how great I felt with anxiety retreats and when I&#39;m having an attack I always keep that warm feeling in mind and keep going. Hope this helps dear. Hold on hunny, it will be fine soon. Hugs Terri </p> <p>Reading through your concerns and im ticking every single thing Halloween night i was sitting waiting for trick or treaters i started toget nervous about answering the door that much that i started to feel chest pains and tightness since then ive been panicking 24/7 about my breathing my chest my heart somtimes looking down at my left breast and seeing that its beating as freaking out thinkin my heart rates too high and then all the symptoms start up again im fairly new to anxiety well to this degree ive always had slight anxiety but this is the worst... I hate feeling like this and i feel like</p><p>Nothing works <img src=\"http://s8.patient.media/forums/emoticons/sad.gif\" alt=\"sad\" /> yet to see a docter and thats another trigger the minute i think hospitals docters medical i freak out <img src=\"http://s8.patient.media/forums/emoticons/sad.gif\" alt=\"sad\" /> </p> <p>I never had anxiety until I found I had a panic attack. What you&#39;re experiencing is a panic attack. You need to relax and stop thinking about what&#39;s going to happen because your brain is doing all of this.&#160;</p><p>3 years ago, I had a root canal performed, after a year it got infected; it had&#160;abscess,&#160;which cause me to have left upper obdominal pain. I noticed my left upper chest would hurt as well. I went to get my blood work. Turns out, I had a bacterial infection in my stomach. My vitamin D was low and I needed more B12. B12 has a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system.&#160;&#160;Before getting my extrated tooth, I remembered my chest would not stop hurting, felt like a heart attack. Same symptom you were experiencing. I noticed&#160;amoxicillin made it worse. After my extraction and getting some surgery done in my jaw. I had bone put in so it would grow back. The dentist told me that my body was going to react to a broken bone and it&#39;ll try to fix itself. He was right. That afternoon, I had a panic attack. I had a EKG, ECHO performed and it all turn out fine. After taking the&#160;antibiotics, probiotics,Vitamin D and B12, I noticed I haven&#39;t had any momments. My doctor told me that I may have a strained muscle in that area also. What happens is all your muscle get stiffened and you feel more pain. Distract youself. Just get your blood work done and find out what you&#39;re lacking. I never had these panic attacks and experinced them twice, one before my tooth extraction and another after my extraction. I remember taking&#160;amoxicillin, and was starting to get allergic to the medication so the doctor told me to take benadryl and that made my heart beat fast when I first had my first attack. Ibuprofen seemed to called me down though. After my infection was cleared. I haven&#39;t felt any attacks. I hope this story helps you understand how crazy our body and brain work. If it detects a problem it&#39;ll try to warned you but sometimes it can get out of hand where it makes you aware of it in a different way. Have your teeth checked. I didn&#39;t noticed I had an infection until I noticed abcess coming out of gums. Didn&#39;t hurt, only would hurt a little with cold and hot water once in a while. Stay healthy.&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p> I have the exact same chest pain and it makes the anxiety worse when it dont go away but trying to keep yourself occupied and the mind in other things it will go away but thank you this article helped me out alot today <p>Omg that&#39;s the same way I feel. I feel like I am dieting. </p> You have exactly what I am going through right now. Pain in the left side of my chest. Keep checking my pulse it is around 74 which is good. I have anxiety and more so now because my mom today moved up from Florida to New York. She is 90 and nervous about the move and it is making me nervous. I took her food shopping today and got pain in my chest and got flushed for about 5 minutes which of course made my anxiety kick in big time. We are spending the first night with her to make her comfortable but I know when we leave tomorrow she is going to be nervous and that will make me nervous. It amazes me how much anxiety can do and cause. Sometimes I wonder can it be anxiety causing pain or pain causing anxiety. <p>This is currently how I feel.. :( i was wondering did your pain eventually go away? I&#39;ve been feeling this way for the past 3 months and I&#39;ve been to the doctors atleast 6 times . I&#39;ve gotten multiple EKGs a few X-rays , blood tests and urine tests as well. I am going to get a KT scan this Monday. My doctor also diagnosed me with anxiety/depression but i feel like that&#39;s not it. Did the pain ever get better for you naturally ? Or any medication you&#39;ve taken to ease the pain? I&#39;ve also been prescribed ibuprofen 800 which will temporarily work but not really. If you could please reach out to me and let me know, I have been searching all over google with descriptions of my pain and yours Is the most relatable I&#39;ve ran into so far!&#160;</p> <p>You probably don&#39;t check this as much anymore but this is also more for anyone that might be struggling with it and finds your post. I&#39;m super excited to have found your post. It sounds like 100% what I&#39;m going through right now. Went to the hospital, did EKG, xray, all normal. I actually had 2 EKGs, one about 3 weeks ago when this started. I was worried because I wasn&#39;t <em>feeling&#160;</em>the pain during the first EKG, but when I had the second one recently, I was having pain during it, and EKG still showed up fine. I&#39;ve even had the lump in my throat. What I was really happy to see is when you said that you wern&#39;t really feeling anxious when one of them started, which is what happens to me and it scares me even more. I&#39;m 25 and I do some high intensity cardio excirsizes, and I&#39;ll never feel any pain during or after, its always later in the evening or something, when I&#39;m making lunch or the like.&#160;</p>"

          "<p>Last week I woke up with really bad chest pains in the left side of my chest. I was alarmed, but I ignored it and went back to sleep, hoping that it would go away when I woke back up. I woke up again and it didn&#39;t go away. The pain was still present. I continued feeling that way throughout the day until it became night time and I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore. I was frightened. I was so scared that something was wrong with my heart. I became so anxious that I started crying because of the pain and how scared I was. I went to the ER and they gave me an EKG. Fortunately, it came back normal and the doctor said my vitals were also fine. I also had a chest x-ray done and that was fine too. They said I may have pulled a muscle by lifting something heavy, but I can&#39;t remember doing that. I was told to take ibueprofen for the pain and the pain was supposed to go away in about a week. Even though they told me I was fine, I wasn&#39;t convinced. The pains started to go away but would come back every now and then. About three days later, I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe well. I kept having to take deep breaths and I became even more scared. My father called 911 and an ambulance came to our house. They said my vitals were fine and my blood pressure was a little high but that was just because of how nervous I was. They asked if I wanted to go to the hosptial and I said yes, because I was truly scared. They gave me an EKG and it was normal, my oxygen levels were fine too. Everything was okay. But I was still scared.</p><p></p><p>When arriving to the hospital, I was given another EKG and had bloodwork done, along with a urine test. They asked me if I had a history with anxiety and I do. But at the time, I didn&#39;t understand how anxiety could affect me in this way. So, I didn&#39;t believe that my anxiety was the reason for it either, because it has never been this bad. They montiored my heart and oxygen, and blood pressure. Then the doctor told me my heart was fine, and my bloodwork was fine. Everything was fine, my EKG, everything. She said she thinks it may have been some anxiety creeping up on me, that&#39;s how she worded it. But at the moment, nothing in my life is causing me to feel anxious. The most that has been bothering me is my worries about my future, but I think that&#39;s normal. So, I was confused because the last time I was told it was a pulled muscle, and now I was told that it was my anxiety. But I wanted to believe what the professionals were saying, so I tried to accept it.</p><p></p><p>About two days later, I didn&#39;t really have bad chest pains. But I had this feeling that there was like, a lump in my throat. I googled different things and I became anxious because the feeling wasn&#39;t going away. I initially thought it might have been strep throat but my symptoms didn&#39;t match up. My throat wasn&#39;t sore, it just felt like something was in it? I felt at times like i was going to choke, or smother, the feeling just wouldn&#39;t go away. So I googled, &quot;lump in throat feeling&quot; and found,&#160;Globus&#160;Sensation. When I saw that it&#39;s something that people with anxiety disorders commonly feel, I felt like that had to have been it. I read through people&#39;s posts and they were describing exactly what I was feeling. I watched a video of some exercises&#160;to do for it, and I did them for myself. Just to give it a try, because if anxiety was the cause for my pains recently, it made sense, right? A short while later, the lump feeling in my throat went away. I was relieved that it worked. Do any of you know the feeling? Is it common? Will that feeling come back? &#160;</p><p></p><p>Now today marked one week since I first started feeling the chest pains and I started feeling pain in the middle of my chest this time, kind of like a sharp pain. I tried to calm myself down and tell myself it&#39;s okay, even though I was freaking out because the pain was in a different are of my chest this time. I was out in public at the time and I had to sit down because it was hurting me that bad. After sitting down for a few minutes and taking deep breaths, along with trying to remain calm, it slowly faded away. I took a long nap after arriving at home, and when I woke up the pain wasn&#39;t there, but it slowly came back. Right now, the pain isn&#39;t that bad, but I feel like it&#39;s still there.&#160;</p><p></p><p>My question is, is it normal for me to feel these pains for this long? And are the pains really because of anxiety? I was told something completely different the first time and now I&#39;m supposedly feeling this way because of my anxiety. I&#39;m just confused and not sure what to believe. I know I need to calm myself down and stop googling things, because it&#39;s just making me worry more. But if I really stop and convience myself that it will be okay, will I really stop being in pain? Will it be okay? I have a follow up appointment with my primary doctor in a day, and I have many questions to ask. I&#39;m 20 years old and have a history of depression and anxiety. I currently take no medications (though I have in the past) and I just want answers, or reassurance. I&#39;m still scared. Scared that the pains will come back because it&#39;s scary when I have them. I&#39;ve never had this kind of experience before, it came out of nowhere.&#160;</p>"

          " hiya james ^_ sorry your having a rough time, but on a practical note, in the short term can you pay bills etc on-line until you feel better about being 'out and about';) it strikes me you really do need to talk to your doctor about this rather than trying to self medicate with over the counter drugs, you say you don't want to swap for another drug but that's in effect what you would be doing by using st johns wort etc. if you dont mind me asking how does your ocd manifest itself and do you still suffer from it, one things for sure is that you are depressed and really do need help from a professional, don't try and 'go it alone' , your not being 'weak' by seeking help, your ill not weak ;) cheers Ken~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^_ Dear James, Hope you are now off the Olanzapine. I found Melatonin useful when I had some insomnia when I tried to come off my Olanzapine medication. I was on 2.5mg for years. Being on the smallest dose I erroneously thought I could just stop taking it. Apart from a bit of insomnia everything seemed ok. After over two months being off it I started getting terrible anxiety heart symptoms - thought I was going to have a heart attack all the time outside. It was very scary. When I finally realized what was going on I went back on the Olanzapine. I'm going to try to get off it again, but will be doing it very slowly. I would urge anybody contemplating to come off Olanzapine, to come off it very slowly, no matter what the dose is. Jon. hi james how are you managing on your olanzapine withdrawel. i found it really difficult and have had to go back on them. although i now dont take them everyday and i keep to the smallest ammount that handles my symptoms, the reason i wanted off them was because of all the weight i put on, nearly 5 stone and the pains in my body that they caused i was hardly able to walk because of sore feet and knees and legs. it was terrible, i stopped the first time,, as i'v had a few attempts at coming off them but always failed, anyway i stopped them dead the first time and within two weeks i was so ill i had to go back on them i was so suiicidal, then went straight back on them and i felt so much relief. then as i couldnt bear the body and weight gain i came off them again, this time i got a pill cutter i bought from the chemist and cut down to 2.5 a day as i was on a low dose anyway becuase my legs swelled up so bad when i was on 10 mg a day or twice a day, so i stuck to one a day for about a month, then i cut down to half a 2.5 a month but i think i came of them so quickly because i started to get really depressed again and what i do now is take 5mg then 2.5 mg for a few days untill i feel a bit better, then i stop again, so its off on again with me but i dont mind as long as im not on them every day i can cope and even the pain is less, thats why i can cope, i'v got so much going on at the moment and i willl try to come off them totally when i get everything else sorted out, i wish you all the best, keep in touch love to you alll,xx sorry i was just checking my post and i mentioned cutting down to 2.5 a month i meant to say a day.  <p>Hi mate, I was taking 10mg of olanzapine a day for a year and I suddenly decided I didn&#39;t need it anymore. I stopped cold turkey. No major symptoms just a light headache. Its </p><p>Mind over matter. Say I&#39;m stronger than this and beat it. Go for a run, eat healthy and keep busy is the main thing and you&#39;ll sleep like a baby.</p> <p>I recently stopped taking olanzapine. I took a moderate dose for eight years. The withdrawal is awful, but I&#39;ve found help and comfort in my friends. When I&#39;m starving, but struggling to make myself swallow, my friend who knows how to make amazing food cooks for me something calorically dense yet easy to eat. When I&#39;m too dizzy to walk, my friends let me brace myself on their shoulder. When I&#39;m too confused to communicate they sit with me patiently while I try to find words. The symptoms aren&#39;t constant. I have episodes where certain symptoms are worse or better. During the good times I get as much done as I can. The rest of the time I rely on my friends. I know not everyone is as fortunate as I am in this regard. But if you have people in your life who love you, don&#39;t be afraid to tell them how you&#39;re doing and ask for support. I suspect my symptoms should start to fade in a few months. In the mean time, it&#39;s the long steady push. What I&#39;m going through is exceptionally painful. It&#39;s embarrassing. It&#39;s emotionally strenuous. But I&#39;m worth it. I&#39;m worth fighting through this and getting to the other side, and so are you. Don&#39;t be afraid of how long it might take. After the sun sets, the dark and the cold can be overwhelming. There are things in the night that haunt us, and there is no glimmer of change in the dark to signal the coming day. But the sun always rises. Always. My advice to anyone, no matter what they are facing, is to steady on, be forward thinking, and remember that you are worth fighting for.</p>"

          "Does anybody know roughly how long olanzapine withdrawal lasts?. I`ve been on it for three years for ocd like paraniod delutions and a genaral feeling of anxiety. at first it was wonderfull, helped me alot especialy with sleep. the problem was that i probably slept for too long (upwards of 14 hours each night) and did very little exercise. i lost all interest in hobbies that i had previosly enjoyed like gardening, cycling, and being close to nature. sometimes just a walk too the beach used to clear my head and when i was well i`d go to the beach or walk around the village everyday, but i just dont get the same satisfaction out of it anymore and generally stay at home, plus i dont have the confidence to go out because i feel people are wispering about me or taking the piss out of my weight or the way i look. i was an active 25 year old young man who enjoyed the simple things in life. now im 28, depressed everyday with health probems. i tapered the dose down gradually to 2.5mg and on on the 1st of march stoped completely and had six weeks of hell, nausia, insonia, anxiety.... it got to the point where i could`nt take it anymore and gave in and began taking it again but after three weeks of being drowzy all day decided to give it another go and i`ve not had any now for five weeks . im not sleeping well and cant eat very much either. the problem now is im a nevous wreck 24/7, im all sweaty and panicy just leaving the house for grocerys and i have bills to pay and jobs that need doing but just having a shower once a day is pretty much all i can manage. its got to the point now where im templed to take it just to get some good quality sleep for a few days, get my appitete back, and look presentable so i can go into town and sort my bills out but i keep telling myself to be strong and try to see the light at the end of the tunnel. some poeple say it can take upto three months for your body to ajust, if anybody has had a similar experience olanzapine and managed to come off if and recover without swaping it for another drug please reply. would st johns wort or melatonin help for sleep? would apreciate any helpfull veiws or coments. thanks. james millington."

          " I know this may sound uninformed and even stuipd. But I have a couple of issues with this whole High Blood Pressure. 1st. It is my understanding that 1/2 of people over 50 have High Blood Pressure. Almost ALL of people over 60 have :\"High Blood Pressure.\" Maybe that is \"the way it is suppose to be\" \"Things\" in the body don't work as well as they once did. Will NEVER AGAIN. and WILL CONTINUE TO GET WORSE. Maybe this is our bodies NATURAL reaction to this situation. And trying to \"Artificially\" lower it is actually MORE DAMAGEING then leaving it alone.  Sorry to hear of your problems and I am sure that having read the postings on this forum you are in no doubt that it is the medication. I sympathise too with the problems having to see different GPs, sadly this seems to have become the norm. I had this problem and what I would do was to book with my 'own' GP even though it was often a few weeks before I could see him so even though I might have had to visit the surgery and see others there in between, at least I got to talk things over with him. He knew my history, and this can make a big difference. Back to your question of what other drugs are available, well there are a number of them, and I think I am correct in saying there are 4/5 main types which act in different ways. (You can look them up on this website) I have had a number of others all with varying 'bad' side effects. My latest is an alpha blocker Doxazosin. Out of all this is the one with the least side effects for me. BUT I hasten to add that different people react differently to them. HOWEVER Amlodopine seems to be the one that nearly everyone has problems with. HI Jani Sorry to hear about your issues with Amlodioine. I too was on this poison they call a medicine. I had many of the sides you\u2019re talking about, including angina like symptoms, problems with my memory & eyesight. I also spoke to my doctor about these sides, but was told they would go away & perhaps it wasn\u2019t caused by the Amlodopine. It seems to me, doctors don\u2019t like to be told the meds they are giving us, can make us worse than our original complaint. I was on 10mg & the higher the dose the worse the sides. Just look on the pages of this site and you\u2019ll see what I mean. I\u2019d been on it for three months and said enough. I followed the advice that a doctor gave to another person on this site, (I think it was) which was to take the tablet every other day for two weeks & stop. It worked for me. You\u2019ll need to be monitoring your blood pressure during this withdrawal as your blood pressure could become higher than they were when you started. Before I started Amlodipine, I had BP as high as 190/110. Whilst on the Amlodipine it came down a bit, but not normal levels. My average now is in the low 140s over 70, it can go as low as 122/59. I\u2019ve been a diabetic for 35 years. One of the main complications is hypertension, due to arterial & heart issues. How did I do it? A lot of research looking at other peoples research led me to: Magnesium glycinate powder 300mg twice a day (I now sleep like a baby) Coenzyme Q10 100mg twice a day (Ubiquinol soft gels, best for absorbtion) Vitamin D3 20000iu (people without knowledge say it\u2019s too high because the daily recommendation is 400ius daily. Studies have shown this is woefully low. If you went walking for half an hour on a sunny day, your body would produce 10000-20000ius of D3 in half an hour) How can 400ius be enough. Omega 3 Fish Oil 1000mg (not containing soya) If you don\u2019t drink milk take some calcium. It works with the D3 & Magnesium Vitamin B-Complex (get a good one don\u2019t get from a high street shop) Vitamin E mixed tocopherols 400ius A note of caution: magnesium and Amlodipine don\u2019t seem to mix. Check out Amlodipine interactions on the net. I had to wait until I was off the amlodipine before taking magnesium. There are many scientific studies to be found on the Internet, regarding all the supplements I\u2019ve mentioned. There is a mountain of data. So look it up and don\u2019t take my word for it. It took a good month and a bit for it all to kick in, but hey, here I am Amlodipine free with BP that\u2019s getting lower and lower week by week. I can hardly believe it. Here\u2019s some bad news. If you\u2019re the kind of person who likes cakes, sugar, bread & all things carbs. You\u2019ll need to cut down. High levels of insulin due to high sugar and carbohydrates intake are damaging to the cardiovascular system. I don\u2019t eat any of this stuff now. Don\u2019t get me wrong, if I was 100% healthy, I\u2019d be in there. A few weeks ago I could hardly walk. I can now. Final note... Honestly, most doctors would rather have you stay on this medicine. They would never recommend what I\u2019ve just mentioned. They must play it safe. I\u2019m glad I did not\u2026 This stuff (Amlodipine) is banned in Holland for good reason. TC"

          "H,i im so glad i found this forum. I was prescribed this drug, 5mg daily, 7 weeks ago for very high blood pressure after having a 24 hour b.p. monitor and have been going downhill ever since. For the last week I have been almost crippled with very swollen feet, ankles and lower leg, which ache all the time and have sharp pains traveling up the back of my legs. Work has been a nightmare ( I have to stand for seven hours a day with one half hour break). Walking is very painful too. Not only that but i feel so tired all the time and I'm getting depressed now. My stomach is upset and a feeling of nausea is present most of the time. I have tried to get an appt with my doctor who has been on leave and is now booked up for 3 weeks! the last 3 visits to the docs have all been with \"other\" doctors at the practice who do not know my history and it was one of these who prescribed amlodipine in the first place. I don't even know if this drug is working to bring down the blood pressure as have not been checked but told to wait 6 to 8 weeks after the first dose. I really dont want to see any doc who is available, I want to see MY doctor, but 3 weeks more of this and i will be in the funny farm so it looks like I will have to take my chances with whoever is available. I would like to be a bit knowlegable about what else i could be taking instead because after reading some of the posts on here Im sure that it is THIS drug that is having such a bad effect on my health. Any suggestions would be gratefully recieved. I am also on Iron tabs, Norethisterone and have just finished a course of 6 Zoladex implants, one every 28 days for another condition but havent had any adverse reactions from any of these in the past.. Thanks to anyone who can help."

          " Hi there I have had anxiety for a long time but really bad over the last year. I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism in 2007 although I think by then I had had it for some time. Medication didn't work aswell as it should have and I got radioactive iodine treatment so now have hypothyroidism. Anyway I was on 6 (100 mcgs) tabs a day for thyroid the highest my Dr had prescribed and have been up and down since 2009. I often wonder if most of my anxiety has been caused by having thyroid problems and if I had been stabilised I wouldn't have been as bad ? ? Anyway I hope you are feeling better really soon. I wish you well.^_ Yeah thyroid problems cause so many symptoms too, fatigue, muscle pains , weight loss/gain, the list goes on and on. Best of luck to you.^_ Yeah it's a shame isn't it. I am an anxious person anyway, but with all the thyroid stuff it's just exacerbated it. We'll get through it somehow. It's just the endless symptoms with both that are so hard to cope with. I have absolutely no energy whatsoever.... Good luck with everything and I hope things improve for you really soon. ^_ <p>My son is acting very strange he is being treated for depression with fluxatine but to no help he is so low now his have sent him home, I have hypothyroidism so dose my husband my daughter and most of my extended family, I feel his problem could be an undiagnosed thyroid problem we are so worried about him, hush wife and children are so concerned and don&#39;t know what to do help!!!!</p>"

          "Mirtazapine appeared to 'poop out' on me around 3 years into my therapy with it. I had been diagnosed with severe depression before going on it I scored almost the maximum on the test. My symptoms were fatigue, nervousness, jumpiness, anxiety, severe depression, insomnia, anorexia, weight loss, itching, migraine, heart palpitations and IBS. The GP tried me on several antidepressants, none of which worked until I tried mirtazapine and it was just amazing. I felt better within days. All of my symptoms disappeared. It was a miracle drug which gave me my life back. Then when it suddenly pooped out my symptoms all came back and I was also diagnosed with chronic kidney disease stage 3. I decided to come off it and tapered off really gradually with very few WD symptoms. I had a period of feeling good again and then wham! All my symptoms returned. I thought I had delayed WD but something in me told me it was a physical illness. \u200bLong story short, we have a new GP and he's sharp as a pin. Did many tests on me and I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. My sympptoms have become gradually worse and I am pretty ill right now, especially with heart related symptoms. I have been put on carbimazole and propranolol. \u200bThe purpose of this post is to urge all of you with depression to get your thyroid checked. It can be very dangerous if it is left untreated and is very often misdiagnosed as depression because it shares most of the same symptoms. Both under and overactive thyroid cause depression. Drugs such as mirtazapine can mask the symptoms. I reckon mirt masked my hyperthyroidism until it became so severe that it just couldn't mask it anymore. That's why it appeared to poop out after working so well for so long. \u200b"

          " I can sympathise with your problem. I developed ectopics and PVCs many years ago, and they subsided for a while. However, when I was on holiday about three years ago they returned and I have been plagued with them since. I am convinced that they are triggered by stomach activity, but all of the medical people I have seen say that there is no connection. They are wrong. I have experienced a particularly bad weekend, including some ectopics yesterday, that was followed a few seconds later with numbness in my head. That scared the living daylights out of me. I went straight to the docs, but of course by then everything was back to normal. Despite being told that these episodes are benign, I find it difficult to rest my mind. The night before last I woke up in the middle of the night, and my stomach was churning with some flatulence present. A few minutes later the ectopics started. So, I say to the medical people how come there is no relation between the two, I think it's time you had a rethink. There are so many people who post on internet message boards who think the same. Are we all wrong? [i:2e9a7e625f]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:2e9a7e625f] I have experienced ectopic heartbeats for many years now and I am only 24 years old. I have seen many cardiologists and have been placed on 24-48 hour heart moniters along with having many echo's. I started with very bad symptoms again approximately 1 1/2 years ago and I would experience runs of ectopics that would scare me to death. I would have 40-50 repeated ectopics with no normal beat in between. I did notice this time around that I experienced a grumbling feeling in my stomach when experiencing ectopics. I would drink milk and try to release wind in order to make myself better. Finally I was persuaded to go back to hospital and see another specialist. He advised that I was suffering from Ectopia, a severe form of ectopic heartbeats, however, was once again like so many times before, told that these beats were benign. It seems very hard to beleive when you are going through such a traumatic time. I did tell the doctor of the relationship between this grumbling and growling sound in my stomach but no attention was paid to this. I sympathise with you both in relation to this condition and do agree that there must be some causal link between the heart symptoms and stomach and digestions problems. One way that I found eased my symptoms was to lie down on my front and hold the front of my body up by resting my elbows on the floor. This does help and sometimes takes the ectopics out of the runs. This is a very frightning condition to have and for me and I imagine for you also it is taken too much for granted by the medical world. [i:7725db2a90]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:7725db2a90] hi i am a 35 year old female also got the same problem! ectopic after ectopic beat! fast heart rate, although been told they are normal and stress dont help! but i have also noticed i get them around my period time, with a very bad grumbling and growling noise and acid in my stomach, i also was thinking maybe there is a connection with the 2 of them???? how they think people can live with these i do not know! its made me not wanna do anything for fear of these start when i am out! i got them when im walking and resting so i cant win... but like i said maybe there is a connection with periods and tummy problems! any suggestions for my problem i would love to hear from you, urs kerrie [i:bf3fbfbe22]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:bf3fbfbe22] Hi I am 26 year old female and have been experiencing problems with my heart since I was about 19/20 years old. It started off with the occasional annoying palpitation but when I turned 21 I was rushed to hospital due to the arrythmias i was having. I have numerous ectopic beats which occur as singles, bigeminy and tri-gemini's aswell as have experience a fast heart rate and then a slow heart rate and i have episodes of 1st and 2nd degreee heart block - i cant tell you how many 24/48 hour tapes I have had done over the last 5 years!!. I had a EPS study last year and was due to get radio frequency ablation at the same time, due to the cardiologists thinking I suffered SVT's because of an extra pathway but this proved to not be the case so I could not have the ablation done. I am so frustrated and depressed. I have been on every arrythmia drug known, without any success - i felt worse on them or got other side effects. I spent all of september and most of october 2005 in hospital and eventually got told I had a totally different condition from what was originally thought - i have something called \\&quot;pacemaker syndrome\\&quot; which you should only get if you have a pacemaker - I dont have a pacemaker. It is that unusual that the electrophysiologist/cardiologist I see is in Glasgow, which is more than 200miles from where i live!!! I feel constantly tired beyond belief and sleep alot...i believe i have a definite connection between my heart playing up when i am pre-menstrual or have a upset stomach - but like yourselves this connection has not been listened to so far...i persisted with my local cardiologist about my hormones and got to see a gynaecologist and am currently getting this looked at. I have had to give up my job and university and feel so guilty that my 8 year old son has to live with this condition also - it is very debilitating and is so annoying when doctors tell you its something you just have to live with - I would really appreciate any response to this e-mail - i am relieved to read that i am not alone but it is so hard to find people who understand what you are experiencing.

You and other registered members will then be able to communicate with each other via Private Messaging (PM) or e-mail.) Hi all, Some and/or all of the above rings pretty true for me, although I am not nearly as far along the track as most of you in regards to the symptoms and length of time with them. I am a 40 yr old male with a history of major operation that do not relate to either the heart or stomach. I had acute ulcerative colitis and had my entire large intestine removed. Related or not I am not able to absorb iron into my system through the small intestine. This results in me being very tired all the time. I have seen my local GP (whom I trust) who is aware of my issues. I also note that my sister-in-law who used to work as a medical insurance underwriter said that symptoms of low iron is &quot;heart palpitation&quot;. I presented to my GP maybe a year ago stating that I was having &quot;pains&quot; in my chest and we went through some tests including &quot;stress test&quot; (hook me up and make me walk hard on the tread mill). It showed nothing. He suggested that I may have &quot;gullet spasm&quot;. Nothing more really happened so I left it at that. That is not until recently. Over the last 3 -4 months I have noticed an increase in the number and severity of the &quot;palpitations&quot; I am experiencing and noted the last time I went to the GP (different locum), my BP was above normal. I currently find that my pulse is higher than normal - I know I am not fit, but around 90 at rest I don't believe is good. I am going to my GP this afternoon to state the following case more fully. Either I have gullet spasm or I think I'm on my way to a major heart attack - well that's the way it feels. I'll let you know what we come up with. Andrew [i:fce358a857]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:fce358a857] Thank you all so much for your replies. It helps so much to know that I am not alone with these symptoms but so frustrating for us all not to be able to pin point the cause &amp; obtain treatment. I have had very severe ectopics for the last 3 days - definitely period related this time as well as food &amp; wind. I ate 2 slices of toast on Wed (brown wholemeal &amp; healthy) and about a half hour later, nearly collapsed with triplet ectopic beats.There was that much wind, I could not believe it. Eventually I was all cried out with wind and they eased to a lesser number for Thursday and Friday - only to return today, Saturday worse than ever.I also felt dizzy and can identify with the lady who said her head felt funny.Mine felt as if there was heavy pressure on the top &amp; my balance was very poor.I also had chest discomfort &amp; pain in my back. It did clear but it was scary right in the middle of the ectopics. Today, they came on suddenly after drinking a cup of tea. It was decaff tea, which I always drink.I took my beta blocker in the middle of the attack and there was a slight ease, only to return again !I have them right now I am becoming scared to eat at all ! Night -time, I agree with everyone is a bad time. I avoid going to bed for as long as poss.I know that the minute I lie down, they start again. Gurgling starts in the stomach,wind rises and ectopic after ectopic begins.My GP told me to try proton pump inhibitors to try and reduce the acid in my stomach. I have tried lansoprazole and sometimes they do help a little - othertimes they provoke even more wind, as they are not designed to counteract wind - just acid.I have eased off of them as I do think they might be making it all worse. I am to have a barium meal in the next 2 mths to see if my gullet is spasming. I think it is &amp; this spasm is knocking the heartbeats out.The medics won't believe me - Comments from my GP &quot;Oh, I get ectopics - they are very common. You should ignore them !!!!!&quot; also a quote from a recently seen specialist &quot; Oh, all the best people get those lol lol !! I am not really worried about those in this symptom list I am writing down. They don't bear a relationship to eating&quot; Where on earth do you go from here with that sort of attitude !!?? I am going to try the squatting position that was mentioned in one of the replies - thankyou - I do something similar so I will certainly give that a try.It would be great if it worked.My best regards to everyone &amp; I will keep viewing the pages. I am sorry for the delay in this second posting but I have not been well as you can imagine ! Very best wishes Jenni [i:266aa228bd]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:266aa228bd] Hi there I am a 31 year old male who has had atrial ectopics really badly since November last year. They just started for no reason! I get Atrial Fibrillation (AF) after vomiting but there is no other interesting medical history. I am in good shape. It took 3 visits to A &amp; E (I was getting feint and dizzy with a really bad run) before someone realised that I wasn't getting the 1 or 2 that &quot;Normal People&quot; get. &quot;The best thing to do is go away and forget about them&quot; I was always told. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr BUT I work for the NHS (I'm a microbiologist) so thought I would try and pester the lovely nurses on the cardiac ward and their help has been terrific. They put me in touch with the Cardiology Doc's and one in particular (who sorts me out when I get AF) has been really useful. I started having 2.5 mg Bisoprolol daily which, for two months completely rid me of the ectopics but gradually they wormed their miserable way back in and they kept upping the dose of Bisoprolol which made my pulse get slower and slower (not that great as I really enjoy exercise) and felt completely lethargic. Tried Disopyramide as well but not really making much difference. I am actually booked to have ablation therapy to stop my AF from happening which, apparently, will stop the Ectopics as well as the extra conduction pathways originate from the pulmonary veins which get fried in the ablation procedure. Fingers crossed. Really hard exercise stops them only while I am exercising. Apparently ectopics either come on while resting/eating or exercise. I get the resting/eating ones which are from vagal stimulation. Therefore when I hammer it on the bike I am ectopic free. Completely fed up with it all; got a 3 year old son and wife who is a nurse = busy life but I just can't resist a feel of that pulse. boom boomboom boom boomBOOM. There it goes again!!!!! [i:887b43a51e]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:887b43a51e] I too have had palpitations/ectopic beats since March 2005 and this happened when I got sunburned in Kenya - which I am sure there was a link. I eventually found a heart specialist who specialises in the rythm of the heart and he suggested betablockers. I did not want to take these as we have been trying for a baby for over two years so I had the catheter ablation in April 2006 - I had to be so persistent about having it done. It was quite scary as it took 3 hours and they don;t put you to sleep but it was worthwile. The consultant could only ablate the ectopic beats in teh upper heart chambers and I don;t experience it from there anymore however I am continuiing to get ones from the bottom chamber so I have to consider whether to have this done in the future. Unfortunately the ones from the bottom chamber have longer gaps inbetween each heartbeat which he said is quite normal. Depending on the type of arythmia you have it may be worthwile considering catheter ablation. I have had really bad episodes like you all too and still get them, it is the most frightening experience and I also found the doctors/consultants really don;t understand how it physically makes one feel with the symptoms of dizziness, shortness of breath etc. I also find it worsens nearer my period and would suggest hormones play a big part because women who become pregnant sometimes start getting palpitations - and pregnant women's hormones are higher. I am fed up with it too as it interferes while I am at work or socially. Another thing to be careful about is at concerts ! I went to see the Blue Man Group recently in London and as soon as the Drums started my heart started jumping all over the place !! I know a few people at work with a similar condition and the same happened to them. I thought I was going to pass out. It is very upsetting and I find that I can;t do exercise or even sit in the sun anymore as it starts them off. Good luck with you all, I really hope it sorts itself out. [i:7504e813b6]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:7504e813b6] i get etopics and i definetly agree it is gut related as i suffer from ulcerative colitis, and when this is flaring up and is overreacting it is causing me to have etopic beats it as though i have drank vast amounts of caffine although i have cut all this out, i think it could be drug related in many cases and stress, as this produces adrenerline which i think causes the etopics, adrenerlline causes pressure elsewhere and everything speeds up. i think it may also come on when people are tired, and the body is wornn out [i:d3800603ec]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:d3800603ec] Terrific to find this site. It would be redundant to say I have had all of the symptoms related to all of the causes (such as gastrointestinal and stress) others have described. I sometimes get paired or tripled beats in a series. I am told this is called bigeminy and trigeminy (sp?). I am a professor of medicine of the eye, and am disappointed that cardiology and general practioners often dismiss what they do not understand in the largess of their knowledge, and do not explain potential causes of that which is to them harmles, even though a cause of anxiety top the patient. I also find that treadmill monitors are &quot;reset&quot; through these missed or extra beats. So I might be running with a steady heartrate of 140 that suddenly dips to 65 on the monitor. I don't believe it is acutally 65, but the monitor is messed up by the irregularity. Is this familiar to anyone else? I hope I am getting into this wonderful discussion group? I am in the United States (Connecticut). Thnaks for any response you may give.

Like you all I have had a nightmare with the symptoms experienced and have definitely felt worse with them as I have become older. I experienced larger runs of ectopics, sometimes all night one after the other with no break which have obvious implications with feeling dizzy. When I was approximately 14 years old I was rushed to hospital with a tachychardia when my heart went to 240 beat per minute. Ever since I have experienced problems in my left arm and the latter two fingers on my left hand, they usually fill with pins and needles and then go numb when ectopics are present. I have seen so many cardiologists I can no longer count and because of their attitude to this condition I decided for many years I would not return to see another one and would try to cope with what was happening. As a result of this I suppose I find a heartbeat where triplets of ectopics happen normal for me but still so devastating because it impacts so much on your life, a concept that many doctors don't seem to understand or in fact don't want to understand. I myself approximately 6 years ago started to suffer from gastric problems. My stomach literally felt like it had a hole in it as when I developed a gurgle/growling noise I could push my stomach out and it would sound like there was a leak of fluid. My family was perplexed by this and of course like so many of you these problems also lead to runs of ectopics. If I wake up with a run of ectopics in the night then I usually have wind that must be released and then the ectopics will go from a run into something a little better so I can rest a little. It has caused me many sleepless and restless nights. It is so frustrating when Doctors and specialists can't advise anything for you and are so flippant about the matter, I for one think it is totally unacceptable. I am now a trainee lawyer and have seen many specialists speak in such a way over the years that could potentially see them legally liable for their actions. Like many of you here state they are dismissive of the ectopics let alone that stomach problems and the ectopics can be linked. The last specialist I went to see stated that it was ''nothing to worry about''. My Mum actually attended this meeting with me and said at the time that the whole family were so concerned about the stomach problem I was experiencing and the heart problem too. He then looked at my Mum and said to her '' well maybe you and her family are stressing her out about the problem'' It was at this point and after many years of coping with Doctors who don't understand the situation that I terminated the meeting and I am now in the process of trying to establish why Doctors are so flippant in this area, taking action specifically in relation to the specialist mentioned above. I will of course keep you all posted of what I find out but I do feel the only way to resolve this is by possibly seeking private health care. This is not an option for many out there however if any answers are given this way then the information can be posted on open forums such as this one and may aid others in pinpointing the actual problem. It is certainly a relief to know so many others are having similar experiences with related stomach and heart problems. I feel for you all and know first hand how much they can impact on your life."

          "I am plagued with ectopic heartbeats and have lapsed into AF upon many occasions. I am only early 40s and these irregular beats have ruined my life. I have a rare illness antiphospholipid syndrome, which as a blood clotting disorder is clearly partly responsible. My biggest problem is that the runs of ectopics always have one thing in common when they manifest themselves - there is always severe gastrointestinal activity just prior to the attack and it precipitates the ectopics so much, I get runs of 5 ectopics for every one beat, which makes me feel faint and sick. I take Bisoprolol in a very low dose 1.25mg, as I develop bradycardia with higher doses.It helps to keep the heart rate under control but does not really supress the ectopic beats. I am convinced that the ectopics are brought on by sphincter incompetence and gullet spasm, and severe flatulence(if I &quot;bring up&quot; loads of wind, the ectopics ease greatly or vanish for the day) Nobody even my GP can definitely confirm a correlation between the severe GI disturbances and the ectopics.I would welcome a paper on this subject which I could read or to know if others share this same set of symptoms.I feel if I can prove the link, I will be taken more seriously and maybe even be halfway to finding a solution. I lost my job three years ago and have never worked since, largely due to MS type symptoms I suffer with my illness but the added ectopics and AF attacks make everything far worse.I would quite literally try anything non invasive to alter my life to something reasonable again !! I have kept a diary and have proved that my ectopics are provoked by GI problems but I can't find anything on the web that confirms this .Reassurance would be so helpful !

          " Hello mate, I sympathise with you, I was diagnosed with viral myocarditis in dec 12 following a small heart attack, I had an Anjiogram, echo etc, and finally a cardiac MRI which confirmed the myo. I have had various changes in meds statins, bp, and bobs, I have had to episodes since dec 12. Aug 13 and early cot. that's 2 more stays in hospital for a day or so. No real further answers than its a time thing.. Having pains today and don't know whether to get checked by hospital or not. It's the unknowing all the time. Btw I am 48 and was trying to get healthier last year by going back to martial arts. I had whooping cough and since then it's been downhill . According to the US sites myocarditis is an on going illness that does pass in an unknown time. Some results in death so I'm lucky there! Deffo not happy that I can't get clear of this as today is really upsetting!!! Hi Tagg1, wow, I feel the same way. I had my CARDIAC MRI a few weeks ago and was told I have severe inflammation on my heart lining (pericardium) and my heart muscle (cardium) confirming that I have Myocarditis. It also shows the infection on my heart, ughrrrr. I still have chest pains, itchy skin, my left wrist feels like someone is squeezing it throughout the day, dizzines and nausea. I went to the hospital in the early part of October and because it is a viral infection there is nothing they can do so of course, I was sent home. The worst part of this condition is you have no certainty in anything. If I broke my arm I know after 6-8 weeks with all being well il get better, but its an affair of the heart, unfortunately we can't see that. We dont know if its healing or not as the bouts come in waves...at least for me anyway. Its the not knowing. The US site Myopericarditis Foundation has been so useful. They also have a forum. The information is fantastic. Ive listened to the past webinars that was held, several times a year it seems. Its a vicious waiting game thta I don't want toplay anymore.....sorry I am so fed up its ridiculous. I was talking to a co-worker today and he told me that he was told he had myopericarditis but his recover time was 6 weeks. No problems after that. So there is hope.....however I think he is an exception. All the best to you Tagg1, keep me posted. Im due to visit my cardiologist on this coming Firday. Il come on for an update then. Take care until!  Hi, hopefully youl get to read this.... Mainly just looking for some advice if you have any... Here's my story... I'm 24, sept just gone I had tonsillitis, I started having really bad chest pains I couldn't breath and had a weird pain in my arms, I went into hospital where at first they just thought maybe I was allergic to penicillin, after a number of tests I was transferred to a specialist heart hosp, after all my tests and MRI scan it was confirmed that the tonsillitis had resulted in me having myo and pericarditis, the whole experience was such a shock to me, I wasn't even allowed to walk to the toilet, I was released from hospital after nearly two weeks and have been on pills ever since, I have an MRI check up scan next week and have only really started thinking about the whole thing and realised, I actually don't really know after deal about it, I no what it is and why it happened but I don't actually no if it's a long term thing or if il be okay, if anything in my life will be affected by it. Isit gone? Can it come back? My partner and I would like to start trying for a baby, in the back of my head I'm worrying about all of this. Should it be an issue?!? I'm slightly clueless tbh and would love .... Something, anything, someone to talk to..... Thanks, and I hope to hear from someone  Hi Emma, I hope this message finds you well. I was told I had Myocarditis in April 2013. It is now January 2014 and I feel pretty much the same. I am including in this message a link to the Myocarditis Foundation, that I found last year in search of answers to the very same questions that you have asked. All of it is a shock. I am still having chest pain. The medication that I was on the bring down the swelling in my pericardium and heart has caused severe problems with my stomach. So that's another change. Every case is different, but from my own experience and what I have researched, it reoccurs throughout your life, you will start to feel better and think all is well and the symptoms come back again, tiredness, heavy chest, I had mushy arms, numbness in my neck and jaws, etc. From what I have found out is that it affects fit and healthy people. I feel very thankful that I am still here as it also kills. Emma, I searched the web as I wanted to talk to someone or even set up a meeting place for people with our condition but because there are so few people with this debilitating condition it wasn't viable. If you ever want to talk or vent, just email me here. The worst problem for me is that my friends don't understand it has nothing to do with blockages, your diet, or any of the such. it is a viral infection that attacks your heart muscle and or heart lining and presents as a heart attack. So I feel I don't have anyone to talk to. here is the link: http://www.myocarditisfoundation.org/I know all of this might be a bit scary, however, you are still here. I would speak to your doctor about you and your partner starting a family. I hope it helps knowing that you are not alone and there are survivors out there having the same feelings of uncertainty as you. Send a message whenever you feel up for a chat. take care of yourself and get your rest, listen to your body. Hopefully it will not last very long for you!  Hello Fizzychris, Reading your experience I thought I would tell you mine for company!. I was diagnosed with Myocarditis on the left side of my heart in Feb 2013, like you, what a shock! I have had 2 MRI's and am waiting for the results of the last one which I had on the 4th Feb. These will be made known in April! Long time to wait eh! To help myself ,I downloaded 'The key to overcoming panic attacks' method. These I believe occur when I am having a symptomatic episode[attack}prefer to call them episodes, feel less like a victim! As you say one can go without symptoms for ages and lulled into the belief that all is well. I had two long episodes [4Omintes] in December then nothing till 3rd Feb.That one lasted 10minutes. MRI dept said it was probably concern about the MRI, though I did not feel at all stressed. In fact almost went to sleep during process.! During episodes I take paracetamol, though I belive Ibobrufen and asparin or nurfen is ok and do the method. I am not on any medication though I do follow the cardiologists advice about not excercising too much and rest when I can {not like me at all!} It has also precluded air flight, well, at least long haul. Need to ask about flights to europe. I miss my family who live in Italy and USA. I am working with affirmations, as there is always an emotional reason when these things happen. Like you, I am happy to be alive. Hope to hear from you and wishing you all the best. Lois Hi Lois, thank you for the company. I have always known how important it is to have people to talk to and share with your friends and family, however, since this situation with my heart I have never felt so alone. I have people to talk too, so I thought I did. Because Myocarditis and pericarditis is so under diagnosed not enough people know about it and the seriousness of its effects it has on the people it attacks. So i am extremely great fun for the company. How weird is it that it attacks fit and healthy people. I thought maybe because we are possibly not resting enough and over working ourselves. ..I don't know. I am so glad for this site and the only foundation that is worth looking at: in my post to Emma I included a link to the US site. I was just on it and they said they're setting up a foundation in Australia and also in the UK. I'm from Alaska, but I've been living here for nearly 13 years now. When I've have my episodes,my new word now, they last until I take the declafenac. I was on ibuprofen but it wasn't working well enough. Are you able to go back to work Lois? I've not been released from the cardiologist just yet. You are so right about the MRI, I either fall asleep or doze sorta in and out. Quite relaxing, he he. I live in Manchester what part of the UK are you in if you don't mind me asking? Wishing you all the best with our episodes. One day at a time is what I say. I so look forward to hearing from you. Take care care until Lois and wishing you well. Christine Hi Christine, I think you are right when you say us fit and healthy people have difficulty in slowing down, I know I used to pride myself with the stamina I had! I certainly rest as much as I can now as this is often part of the treatment for this condition. I am a semi retired complimentary therapist, using herbal products to underpin my treatments. I am taking a very good quality multi vitamin recommended by a heart surgeon at Hartlands, ginko and hawthorn, vit E and C, high potency garlic,omega 3 fish oil. Cook with ginger and garlic and daily turmeric for infammation. My affirmation is Joy,joy,joy fills my mind,body and experience, my thinking is peaceful, calm and centred. I live in a village in Hampshire. I am also a colour consultant so I am able to continue with this part of my work. Are you able to work Christine?I will keep you in my positive thoughts and prayers and we will speak again soon. Lois Hi Lois, Thanks for your prayers and positive thoughts. I'm not cleared for work yet, unfortunately. Have you managed to take a look on the myocarditis foundation website? Take care Lois. My thoughts and prayers are with you also. Christine Hi. Normally a fit and healthy person (46 years), I'd had a nagging cough of varying degrees since New Year (2014). In early March I had a deep-ache pain in my chest which spread down into my left arm. A call to the NHS resulted in paramedics arriving within 8 minutes and an ECG showing \"inverted T-wave\". At hospital, bloods showed high troponin levels confirming a heart attack. Then an angiogram showed clear arteries (no stent required). An echo-cardiogram revealed reduced pumping efficiency. The following day, having been denied Ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory, my cough and breathing worsened - my \"bit-of-a-cough\" was then diagnosed as pneumonia. Still on the CCU ward, it was a week later before an MRI reversed the heart attack diagnosis, with myocarditis (brought-on by pneumonia) in its place. Following the MRI results I was discharged within 2 hours with a bag of goodies including antibiotics, Ramipril 2.5mg, Bisoprolol 1.25mg, and a 2 week sick-note. I was genuinely feeling better, but the Ramipril in-particular made me extremely dizzy with bouts of low blood pressure leading to frequent near-blackouts. My GP reluctantly agreed to halve the Ramipril dose (enabling me to drive), and I went back to work on-schedule. On advice, I halved the dose again 4 weeks ago, taking it every 2nd day, then every 3 days last week. The Bisoprolol also made me dizzy, gave me muscle and back pain, severe fatigue, fogging my brain and making it difficult to concentrate. Following the last repeat prescription I became extremely irritable with everything and everyone (it was a different manufacturer - if that could make any difference). I saw my consultant on Tuesday and she agreed I could cease the Ramipril, and could taper-off the Bisoprolol over 4 weeks. Feeling so awful by this stage, I found info suggesting I would be safe to stop Bisoprolol completely having skipped one tablet the previous day, taken one, then skipped 2 days - my residual dose should be down to 3% of the minimum I was on after 75 hours. At that point why-on-earth would I ever want to take another? I'm now into my third drug-free day and feel symptom free and full of life again. I'm keen to get back to my martial arts - but am now thinking of waiting a little longer after reading these replies!  Hi Frizzychris, thanks for getting back. I had an echocardiogram last week and have been told everything is back to normal. Still drug-free! I took my son as-usual to karate on Saturday - though thought it best to sit out as it was an extra-long session. Saying that, I couldn't resist putting some spinning hook kicks into the bag at the end - something I could not have contemplated with the dizziness I was suffering from Bisoprolol and Ramipril. I have a holiday coming up in a few weeks, so I'll leave-off training at-least until after that. Hopefully airport security won't have a problem with my stick of nitro-glycerine (inhaler) which I'll keep nearby just-in-case. I did take a look at the website you linked to, thanks. Hoping you continue to improve with no further setbacks. whilst on a short break to London (I'm Australian living in the Netherlands) in June I was admitted into hospital after suffering stabbing chest pains all afternoon and pain in my left arm. An ecg was made and blood taken. The docter came with the results being either Myocarditis or Pericarditis. They put me on heart medication and hooked me up to a telimetric box. The next morning I had a heart attack. After a couple of days I was transferred to The Heart Hospital where they did an angiogram. I had 'the arteries of a young person I am 60 years of age, I live a healthy lifestyle, have never smoked, I don't drink alcohol, and have a healthy weight. After a couple of days I was tranfered  Right, something went wrong there and I couldn't edit it. I of course meant a telemetric box. Back in the Netherlands I started on heart rehabilitation, most of the time I get through the excerises okay, other times I start to get chest pains. I have noticed that 30 minutes of doing ANYTHING is too much and I suffer for the rest of the day. I have a heart MRI sceduled for July 22nd, results August 1st. Hi, I too got taken to hospital in the uk with atypical heart attack symptoms just 5 weeks ago, I had had a cold and a cough for weeks before, my echo was normal as was my ecg and my angio. They say it may be spasm or broken heart syndrome or myocarditis, but I was re admitted last week and my tropinin was normal, I am worried that myocarditis will not show now on my mri which is in 3 weeks. They may never know what it was, my ct scan was also normal. Even though they don't know what it was I am on statins, diltiazem and aspirin for life. My tropinin was at 20538 but went back to normal after 7 days in the meantime I am also on Prozac and diazepam due to severe anxiety. "

          "My story in short. While riding my bike at an extremely slow pace. I became short of breath, dizzy and experienced numbness in my arms. Went to the emergency room told them what happened..had an ecg that came back normal, my chest xray came back normal. But thanks to the wonderful doctor he said he would like to take one more test just to be sure. It was the tell tale sign of any heart damage ..the troponin test came back at 13. quite high. Normal troponin level is 0.02. Had every drug they could give me as I was told I had an heart attack. Taken to the ICU Heart Care Unit after days days of fantastic care given to me I was off to another hospital for an Angiogram to fit stents in my arteries to open up the blockages. Came out of surgery and asked the surgeon how many stents do I have.. though I led an advanced aerobics class and road my bike 14 miles 2-3 times a week, dont drink alcohol, Logistics Coordinator of a Fruit and Veg scheme, eat healthly. Its possible that maybe I had 1 too many curries. The surgeons response was you have pristine arteries. Wow! Great thanks. So why all the chest pain. Well that was in April 2013, I was told I contracted a viral infection of some sort. Bed rest for two week Ibruprofen 3 times a day. The inflammation of your heart muscle and heart lining should clear up. July same thing but I was sitting down couldn't catch my breath the muscles in my arms felt like they were turning to mush. Now on 50mg of Declafenac, 16mg of Cocodemol both 3x a day and 1 Omneprazol once a day. I am due to have my MRI Stress Profusion test soon. I just want to know is there anyone suffering with this rare heart condition? There is no cure. Footballers and otherwise healthy people die suddenly from it. Talking to my friends is pointless as they still say \"Ohh just keep watching what you eat\" \"Eat healthy foods no snacking\". It is so clear that they are not listening to me. Does anyone know of someone else that suffers with this debilitating disease?"

          " Tafia - You can take or refuse medicine as you wish. Doctors often have to weigh up the pros and cons of medicines. I am type 2 diabetic and also have fatty liver (although not excessively overweight). I had three goes at various statins (my cholesterol was about 6.5) but I suffered severe muscle pain in both my shoulder and hips (mainly left side); no mention was made of them further damaging my liver. Because of side effects I declined to take any more statins. With a change of doctor, she suggested I have another go with them and I am currently on 40mg Simvastatin, I have found that by taking them with my evening meal, instead of last thing at night as was previously the case, I have avoided any apparent side effects and my last Cholesterol was 3.5. I think the problem is that there are arguements from all sides which are partisan and people feel they are not getting the full story or the 'truth'. Personally I am against taking any medication that is not immediately needed and the idea of pumping half the population full of any medication 'just in case' can only be storing up more problems later on. Ultimately we are all going to die; most of us would prefer it was later rather than sooner but if one thing doesn't get us something else will. As you say, you might not get a heart attack but could meet your demise from a result of side effects from a medication.  Well you are an obsinate old B****r just like myself. At our age, what the Hell, how many years are they going to add to our lives? If you have not had any heart trouble or strokes do you really need them. Have you had your levels tested before? If so how much have they gone up? Las year I was 5.7 and this year 6.3 and my doctor will test me again in three months. I did start statins in March 2011 when I was found to have aortic stenosis but my areteies were clear. It was not long before I had muscle pains so I stopped and started a few times to prove the point. No way will I take them again. She has every right and needs give no reason to reject you as a patient if she so wishes. You could of course take the snaky way out and take the prescriptions but not take the tablets. My GP says that 40% of his patients don't take what is precribed so join the Club. Latest from today's Daily Mail............ Millions of healthy Britons are about to be given statins needlessly and exposed to debilitating side effects which include muscle pain and diabetes, leading doctors warn. They say NHS proposals to radically increase the uptake of the drugs are a \u2018public health disaster\u2019 that will cause harm to many patients. The group \u2013 which includes cardiologists, and senior GPs \u2013 is urging the government and the NHS drugs watchdog NICE to halt the plans. They also claim that eight of the 12-strong panel of experts who are drawing up the guidelines have financial links to drugs firms making statins \u2013 which stand to make a profit. About seven million patients in Britain take statins to lower the cholesterol in their blood to prevent heart attacks and strokes. They are predominantly given to over-65s who have been diagnosed with heart disease or have a high risk of developing it based on their family history or lifestyle. But in February, NICE \u2013 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \u2013 published draft guidance advising GPs to prescribe statins to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke within the next decade. It claims this could save many lives at a minimum cost to the NHS as the drugs cost as little as 10p each. Experts say this would lead to the drugs being given to between five and ten million additional patients. NICE will publish its final guidelines next month. But the group of doctors say there is no evidence that giving statins to healthy people increases their life expectancy. On the contrary, they point to evidence showing they increased the risk of diabetes in middle-aged women by 48 per cent and cause fatigue and muscle pain. The group also accuse NICE of looking only at evidence about benefits and possible side effects of statins that have been provided by drugs firms, which could be biased. The leading doctors also argue that rather than prescribing statins, the NHS should be encouraging patients to lose weight and take more exercise. In a letter to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and NICE, they wrote: \u2018The consequences of not withdrawing this guidance are worrying: harm to many patients over many years, and the loss of public and professional faith in NICE as an independent assessor. \u2018Public interests need always to be put before other interests, particularly pharma [the drugs industry].\u2019 Professor Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, one of the doctors against the move, said: \u2018The statin recommendations are deeply worrying, condemning all middle-aged adults to lifelong medications of questionable value.\u2019 Dr Malcolm Kendrick, a GP and member of the BMA General Practitioners sub-committee, who is also a member of the group said: \u2018Who knew that millions of people in the UK now suffer from statin deficiency syndrome? Mass statination is a triumph of statistics over common sense. \u2018Treating millions at a cost of billions based on data we are not allowed to see is an example of the corporatisation of medicine and will result in a public health disaster.\u2019 And Dr David Newman, director of clinical research at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, said: \u2018For most people at low risk of cardiovascular disease, a statin will give them diabetes as often as it will prevent a non-fatal heart attack.\u2019 In response, Professor Mark Baker, director of the Centre for Clinical Practice at NICE, said: \u2018Cardiovascular disease maims and kills people through coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and stroke. Together, these kill one in three of us. Our proposals are intended to prevent many lives being destroyed.\u2019 And now for the punch line: Concerns have been raised that eight of the 12-strong panel recommending widespread use of statins have financial links to the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture them. They include Dr Anthony Wierzbicki, chairman of the NICE panel and a heart disease specialist at Guys and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital in London, who has ties to six firms, including Pfizer, Sanofi and Aventis, which sponsored his research into cholesterol-lowering drugs. Dr Michael Khan, a heart specialist at University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire, has been paid by drug companies investing in heart drugs to give lectures and sit on advisory boards. They include Amgen, a US firm which makes statins that has sponsored him to run a clinical trial. Emma McGowan, a specialist heart nurse who also works at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, was sponsored by statin manufacturers AstraZeneca for the first year of her job. She was also paid by the same firm to attend conferences. Dr Robert Dermot Neely, heart specialist at the University of Newcastle, has been paid by statin makers Roche, Genzyme and Aegerion to sit on advisory boards. The experts declared these conflicts of interest to NICE. The Mail contacted them for comment but did not receive a reply.  Thanks for your responses, folks. I recall my levels were above 8 a couple of years ago and my doctor at that time did not push statins onto me as the new one appears to be doing. I have lost about 10 lbs in weight in the last few months so that may be one reaon the level has fallen. My new GP did not mention diet and exercise as the Mail article above suggests. I did ask if I could reduce the levels by diet ( not that I want to reduce it as it seems a level just above 7 could be protective, from what I have read) but she repeated that her advice was that I should take them. I object to taking them as I have read a lot on the subject and the number needed to treat is very high; a lot more than 1 in 50 whilst the chance of them causing me damage is much greater. It seems bizarre that I am being recommended to take a drug which has the potential to damage my liver, this potential must be quite high or she would not be telling me to take a blood test for liver function a month after starting on statins. Does any one know what being \"exception reported as a non-complier\" means? Go to another member of the practice! I took statins for just 10 days 2 years ago and couldn't walk 50 yards after a week because of the muscle effects. The cardiologist I was under was perfectly happy. It took a year to get back to anything like normal. Two years later my cholesterol is now just about normal through diet - only not normal because the HDL is so high! She probably thinks you don't understand the science - but I understand it the same way you do. The thought of \"everyone over 40\" being given them scares me to death. But darn the woman - it is MY/YOUR body and like you, I see no reason to poison it with them to make money for the drug companies.  As the cholesterol is actually produced by the liver it may be that your doctor is wanting to check the values of various outputs from the liver. As to diet; I have read many conflicting stories about how diet affects cholesterol as it does notcome directly from what you eat. Eskimoes eat masses o blubber - whole fat yet have low cholesterol. My doctor said there was no need for me to stop butter or bacon. I have a feeling the levels are tied to genetics as my mother also has a cholesterol level of about 6 (at age 82). Her doctor has pushed her to take statins bu she got tsme side affects as me. told her that,at 82, it's probably a bit late to worry about cholesterol levels. I think with diabetes it may be a bit more crtical as the disease can give a higher rsk of heart attack and stroke. I don't understand what your doctor is saying but she may be under pressure to place patients on Statins so she will record you as having been offered but refused. It is very unlikely she would want to shed you as a patient because of that; it sound like she is not very good at communicating since all current instructions are to put patients at the heart of their treatment and give them full control over all aspects of their treatment."

          "Hi, Having read a lot about statins, the very high numbers needed to treat and the harm they can do, I told my doctor I did not wish to take them. We almost ended up by arguing as she dismissed my concerns and insisted that her advice is that I should take them. Mu current level is 7.3. I showed her research which showed the numbers needed to treat (NNT) for statin use in those who have not been diagnosed as having heart disease is between 50 and 250; I showed her a pro-statin study which said if 1000 patients were statinised for 5 years, just 18 events of cardiac disease would be avoided. The study hailed that as a success! Still she repeated her advice. I asked if I still refused would she have me exception reported as a non-complier and she shrugged which I took to mean 'yes'. My previous doctor, now retired, understood my reluctance to take statins and the reasons for it and didn't push them onto me. It seems that the new doctor is now bullying me into taking her advice to take statins. Blood tests have all shown my liver to be functioning as it should and yet the new doctor told that if I take the statins I must have another test to ensure they are not damaging my liver, a known possible side effect! Given the huge controversy around statin use, can anyone tell me where I stand if I still refuse to take the doctors advice? Can she kick me off her list at a surgery where I have been a patient for 70 years?"

          " I went through a similar thing a few years ago, and it's utterly horrible. I used to take my BP ten times a day, 5 times each time because I was worried about how high it was when I wasn't taking it. It didn't help that the GP only focussed on the higher readings, and not on the ones that were around the 75/43 mark! Eventually I was referred to a cardiologist, who was also a Yale professor, and the top cardiovascular professor in London. Ge assured me that with other tests he'd done - like looking at the backs of my eyes - that my blood pressure was fine, and that it was supposed to fluctuate throughout the day. He'd written the blood pressure guidelines for the European Union, so he should know. He accepted anything up to 140/90 as ok, and said that the guidelines in the United States stated anything over 120/80 as high BP was because the pharmaceutical industry wanted to sell their medication. Because I only felt safe with readings of 90/60 or less, he said I was endangering myself and that I should go and get therapy. So I did just that! I'm forced to take my BP once a week at the moment, and occasionally feel the anxiety creeping back in, but it's not nearly as intense as it was, and I can go a full week without thinking about what my blood pressure is doing. Trust me, that's amazing!! So, with all that said, I would suggest the same thing to you - get some therapy to help you manage the anxiety. I realise that's often easier said than done if you're in America... But if you're in a country with decent healthcare, please start the referral process for therapy as soon as possible.  Sam, even 135/90 is not really much to worry about. What does your doctor say? If you're just taking a half-dose of beta blocker, you could easily be given additional meds. In the US it's pretty much standard to take two, three, or four meds, from different classes, all together. Meanwhile are you following the dietary advice for BP? Is your weight OK? Do you get at least a moderate amount of exercise? Are you stressed out about anything other than your BP? Are you nice and relaxed when you take the BP reading? Unless you are getting readings over 150/100 all the time, or something over 160/110 when you are quiet and relaxed, you're in very little immediate danger. When it gets to 180/120, then you might want to really worry! But even 132/88 is just 10% over 120/80, and that's not something that's going to be a problem this year or next year or the year after. In twenty years, maybe. Or maybe not even then. You have heard about white coat hypertension, this is same but without the white coat. The text book solution is to take the BP twice at one minute interval. If the readings are more than 5 points apart than take a third reading. Subsequent readings should be okay.  HI I felt I WOULD ANSWER BECAUSE I get white coat syndrome .. but i have it now even when I TAKE MY own BP as well I was tryng i f or way over a year to get my BP down and be aware several drugs actually make you ANXIOUS and raise BP! I had to try 6 + before .. I found one. Some made me SUICIDAL with thoughts which stopped as soon as I STOPPED THE PILLS. I TAKE Losarton POTASSIUM 25 AND I CAN LIVE WITH THE SIDE EFFECTS , at least until after a hip operation I need and they wont do with high BP I MOSTLY WANTED to say that 135 / 86 is not the ideal it is not dangerous although anyone can correct me . Mine was going to 231/109 and when it is that high you know it the body gives you warning so try to de stress by knowing yours is not so high and enjoy. I also found i had to do mine every day for a long time but have tried to limit it. CHECK OUT ALTERNATIVE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO HELP to take along with your meds like hibiscus tea it works, there are many things . good luck .  i also get very anxious about my BP. It helps to know i am not the only one. I have a hard time hitting the 120/80 goal. The worry cycle does not help. Try some deep breathing exercises to try to calm your body. We can't always control our anxious thoughts but our breathing is something we CAN control. Count to five as you breathe in and then count to five as you breathe out. You are going to be okay!  Hello, I too suffer from extreme bouts of anxiety. I suffer from white coat syndrome and everytime I go to the doctor my blood pressure shoots up like a rocket . When I take it at home it's fine unless I am having an anxiety attack. My problem is I get something in my head and I keep thinking about it until it drives me crazy. Anything health related or financial related and I am worrying uncontrollably. I also google everything till I am so stressed I cant sleep. I take anxiety medication but, it never goes completely away. Hang in there and know you are not alone !\ud83d\ude0a Thank you every one for great suggestions & nice words. I think it really helps to hear different experiences and it gives some assurance that whatever is happening to me is not unique and it is part of life. Thank you again everyone. 5 years ago i started getting hints of high blood pressure every time i had it done just from eye appointments and physicals. Then i spiked it one morning after i had a cup of coffee had an anxiety attack and i could feel my blood pressure every day and know when its up. If you have caffeine drinks stop, it triggers anxiety which make bp go higher. i have have not had a caffeine drink since.  hi there im obsessed to its ruining my life constantly takeing my blood pressure its 120/90 which really scares me i told my doctor he said hes not worried about it but i am as my mum died from a enlarged heart from haveing high bloodid pressure"

          "Hi Everyone, I am looking for some help in dealing with my anxiety about hypertension. I have really bad anxiety about my blood pressure. It all started 1 year back when I first diagnosed with hypertension. I started with 25mg Metoprolol Succ. and now down to 1/2 dose. At the beginning I was feeling very anxious about getting hypertension at relatively young age(31years). Eventually I was able to accept that but now I become very anxious about my blood pressure numbers. Anytime I try to measure BP now, I feel super anxious and many times it drives my number higher and it makes me more anxious and I just keep thinking about that thing entire day. Several times I have measured normal blood pressure numbers but still I get very nervous every single time when I try to measure my blood pressure. Somehow I have developed obsession to get my readings close to 120/80 which drives me nuts. many times I get numbers in 130-135/86-90 range and I get panic really bad which drives my number even higher. I know those numbers are not great but they are not that bad either but I start thinking about extreme worst. I tried another approach as well by promising myself to measure BP only once a month but that also did not help. in 10-15 days I started thinking that what if my blood pressure is not normal, what if its too high and my panic triggered again. This anxiety is killing me. I get all other weird feelings because of that. Has anyone gone through similar phase? I will really really appreciate some tips to deal with this."

          " Hi Adele I'm 36 and have also recently been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and have never suffered with psoriasis previously.My joint pain started a few months ago with swelling in my fingers and now it seems to be affecting my hips, back, knees and shoulders. I have developed the odd small patch of psoriasis which seems to come and go and leaves white marks. I also have endometriosis and have wondered if the two are connected?? I am waiting for an appointment to come through any day with regards to starting medication..sulphasalazine. The rheumatologist was going to put me on methotrexate but decided not to,due to be being prone to infections at the moment. Anyway I cannot offer any advice to you I'm afraid being a newbie myself,but just wanted to send you my love and I hope you are soon feeling better. Feel free to pm me if you need to chat. Take care Nat x It takes some people a few months for MTX to kick in. And yes, it's often hard to adjust to MTX at first, which is why typically most rheumatologists will start you off at 5 mg and will increase the dose each week or so, depending on how you're tolerating it. Also, you should be taking 1-2mg of Folic acid to offset the effects of the MTX. Most people take NSAIDS or a short course of Prednisone to help with the pain and inflammation. It is a board certified rheumatologist who is prescribing and taking care of you, right? [Please don't say it's a consultant because my next question will be, WHAT KIND of consultant?] Hang tight. It will be worth it. I was diagnosed over 20+ years ago and the MTX served me very well. Nowadays I take MTX with Humira and it's been a total life changing experience [for the better]. Hi Natalie & Lynn Thank you so much for the reply, I am also 36 and it's come as a big of a shock. It started with a pain in my hip which went to both hips and then my fingers started to swell. It's now pretty much in my toes, knees, hips and fingers! I also suffer with my neck too. I never get psoriasis but the Consultant said its likely that will come. I started the Methotrexate 6 weeks ago and tote first couple of times I was so unwell I got sent home from work. My Consultant specialises in PA. He started me on 10mg I'm now on 15mg and am waiting to be referred on the NHS so that I qualify for the biologics. I have to prove that I have tried the other medication for at least 5 months. It's getting to the point where I'm wondering if it's really bad enough to be feeling this sh*t the whole time. I know the illness can make you feel tired but I'm just so exhausted and have no energy or interest in anything. I don't think the pain was as bad as this! Sorry to whinge! Xx  Hi Adele I have had Psoriasis for 35 years and in 2001 i was diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis I now have 2 bent toes because of it and also my finger would have been the same but i wore a splint to keep it straight and have no problems with it today. My rhuematologist started me on Sulphasalazine after months of NSAIDS but had to come off it after a month as my white blood cells went down to border line, i had to take antibiotics until the count was up again. I was told they would try me on Methotrexate next, but i didnt need to take it as my Psoriatic Arthrits pain and inflammation went and i have not had it back since, just the Psoriasis. So my advice to you is dont ever give up hope that one day you could be free of this like me, get rid of the negative thinking be positive, eat healthy foods, just live your life as normal as possible. I had to look after my 2 sons on my own when i had this as i was divorced and had no help from my ex husband. I remember my feet hurting so much and limping everywhere. Dont ever think you have this for life, be strong. xxx We all usually try to treat the consequences, not the causes (inflammation). People are different but the principle is the same - you must lose the cause of the disease! I had psoriatic arthritis and about six years ago it really flared up in my joints so I couldn't exercise anymore and about two years ago patches started appearing on my skin and under nails- diagnosis code L40.0(-) and now I\u2019m fine using a new 100% natural Omega 3 product from a North-European producer (they promise a ratio of 3:1 or lower). As I was sceptic I measured, and still do, Omega 3 effect and Omega 6:3 ratio due to its importance! I use a blood test from leading independent laboratories. This is a simple dry blood-spot test for home sample collection. Leading laboratories analyze the sample to determine your fatty acid profile as a reflection of your diet. The balance test identifies levels of 11 fatty acids in the blood with 98% certainty. You will learn your blood levels of omega-3 and your ratio of omega 6:3 for balance, plus receive a report to increase your health and dietary awareness. Test results will show whether your diet is balanced or unbalanced. My first test ratio was 8,4:1, second after four months 3,4:1 and third a year later 1,6:1 and I\u00b4m fine.Finally, if you hold a ratio 3:1 or lower then all life style diseases (skin, joints, asthma, allergies, diabetes 2, high blood pressure, thyroid, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases etc.) will start disappearing and I know lot of recovered people now. Hi Adele, I have not got psoriasis, and could not tolerate Methotrexate, and 3 others. I then started on another one working up slowly. This all happened over about 8 months, and I felt ill all the time and very depressed, which has never happened to me before. When my blood pressure went up significantly, I investigated the side effects further, as my hands were no better through all this. I then wrote a list with pros and cons, and against dangerously high blood pressure and possible failing kidneys, plus all the other effects that I was getting, I suddenly saw the light and stopped taking the meds. Within a week I felt back to me! and all the side effects started to go. I took my life back, and I felt reborn. Okay, so my hands hurt most of the time, and I take painkillers, but I would much rather that. People said to me, 'surely they wouldn't give you anything dangerous' but my answer to that is - All they care about is curing the problem in their department. If you end up in another department that is not their problem. For me, I made the best decision and I will not consider any of those medications again. I have lots of animals so I have to be active, I just get on with it, but at least I feel healthy. I am 65. Hi, I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis about a year ago and all I have is one small patch of psoriasis on my foot which comes and goes. I was first put on sulfalazine which didn't do much good because I kept getting infections and had to come of it. I came of it permanantly after I was losing control of my bladder at night without realising, The doctor put it down to some sort of seizure and I came of it completly . I am now on Methotraxate, 15mg like yourself. I feel so drained, No energy and flu like. It is difficult as I have an 11 yer old and dont have the incentive to do anything with her, I feel really quilty about. But I keep hoping like some of the other stories in here that the situation will get better with perserverance.  Hi Adele, I don't know whether you will still be following this after three months, but just in case... First, hope that you are feeling better now and that the Metho isn't causing you as much discomfort. I was diagnosed in 2005 and have been taking Methotrexate since 2006. I was first tried with Sulfasalazine, but that made me ill. Since starting with the Metho I haven't looked back. I have had a lot of pain, in various joints, and have a slightly twisted toe, but nothing that causes problems. I am 62 now, and do Tai Chi, jog, go out with friends, and generally feel fine and enjoy my life. It takes a while for the pain to abate, but don't give up. It will do in time. Good luck. :)  Hi Adele, I was finally diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondilitis about 15 years ago and moved around a lot with work, so lots of different rhuematology departments visited from Oxford to Bath.I suffered with Arthritis in most of my joints aswell as psorasis. after trying all the front line drugs Methotrexate etc and all the skin creams which didnt do it for me my rhuematolagist (a wonderful understanding person) fought to get me on to the newish at the time anti tnf drugs. I started on enbrel then on to humira and it totally changed my life, hardly any joint pain except the odd flare up and no psorasis It totally changed my life. we all know how painful and depressing this illness is but I just wanted to share with you my experience. there is light at the end of the tunnel. good luck asnd I hope you find the treatment that works for you. Hi Everyone, Sorry for the late reply, I've had a bad few months. I was attacked by a dog whilst walking my dog just before Christmas which resulted in my arm being \"crunched\" and requiring two operations! Not great to be honest but after having a plate inserted I'm getting there. They stopped my Methotrexate as they said it would affect the healing of the fracture so I'm now waiting to go on the biologics! My fingers are really bad at the moment - not sure if I can post photos on here but it's completely crooked which is very upsetting and it's happened quite quickly but hopefully the biologics will help once I start them. Natalie how are you getting on? "

          "Hi, I have recently been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, I've never had psoriasis and am really down about it. My fingers and hips are the most painful and I have been started on Methotrexate. I'm finding it so hard to tolerate I am on 15mg and it's taking me four days to feel normal after taking it. Six weeks in and it's not helping the pain and it's making me feel so unwell! Any advice would really help."

          " Ouch! You haven't 'recovered' very fast - you haven't recovered at all. All you have done is correct your circulating level of vitamin D. The damage to your skeleton will likely take months to sort out. The bone and joint pains in vitamin D deficiency are caused by osteomalacia - the softening of bone as calcium is removed by other metabolic processes and not replaced. (This is known as rickets in children.) The bones, which have become softer especially at their ends, get squashed when loaded with your body weight at these soft points and stimulate pain signals from the nerves. Your body will hopefully be responding to the vitamin D now and remineralising themselves, but it doesn't happen overnight. Professor Michael Holick, who is a world authority on vitamin D, says that it takes six months to a year to reverse the bone softening of osteomalacia. You can find several informative lectures by him online if you are interested. I'm not sure where you are based, but most UK doctors have been advised to prescribe vitamin D long term in cases of deficiency. If he or she won't, you can buy it yourself as a vitamin supplement. Your swollen middle finger doesn't sound like a consequence of vitamin D deficiency - you could have another form of joint issue going on at the same time, and I would pursue this separately. All best wishes, :-) The \"sunshine\" vitamin is a hot topic. You may have recently found out that you are deficient or know someone who is. It's shocking for most people when they have never had a problem before and believe nothing has changed to make it a problem now. The truth is that a lot has changed, and vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is now a global public-health problem affecting an estimated 1 billion people worldwide. The most well-known consequences to not having enough vitamin D are rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. These are far from the only problems associated with a vitamin D deficiency. The consequences are numerous and include skeletal diseases, metabolic disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, infections, cognitive disorders, and/or mortality. The majority of our knowledge about vitamin D has been discovered over the past 15 years, and with the growing issue of deficiencies, more health connections with vitamin D levels are being made. Correcting vitamin D deficiency is not as simple as taking a pill or getting more sun. This article will teach you all that you need to know about the benefits of achieving and maintaining optimal vitamin D levels. Vitamins are considered essential nutrients because either your body cannot make them or they are made in an inadequate amount. This means you must provide them through your diet or by taking a supplement. They are essential for your health, and when you are lacking in them, there may be health consequences and diseases. I'd keep taking the vitamin D supplements but in a smaller dose as the body (bones) can take up to a year to recover from severe vitamin D deficiency, regardless of your \"normal\" levels now. It's called maintenence and a dose of 1,000 IU a day or getting 15 minutes of sunshine each day will keep you from becoming deficient again... unless there's an underlying problem such as alcoholism or a stomach disorder which stops the body absorbing nutrients, which doesn't seem to be the case here. If your finger continues to give you any problems, then ask your doctor to refer you to a specialist for further testing. Best of luck. x"
