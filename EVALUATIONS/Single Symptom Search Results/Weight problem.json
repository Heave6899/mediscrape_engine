          " <p>Hi there I&#39;m from the UK to have you every had a camera put down to see what&#39;s happening &#160;or a barium meal done ? I&#39;ve had this done three times and they always say it&#39;s all ok no cancer I just have acid reflux for me the symptoms are throat clearing and heartburn hurendace heartburm I&#39;m on PPI medication 30mg a day It doesn&#39;t help that much I did purchase the acid watchers diet but have &#160;yet to try it , is it easy to do I notest some of the ingredients are American can you buy them here in the U.K. I really want to cut down the PPI &#160;medication because it&#39;s making me lack in vitamin D3 and Calcium so now I&#39;m getting Joint &#160;pain and thinning &#160;bones I can&#39;t take the calcium tablets that really upset my stomach I&#39;ve had this for the last 5 years&#160;</p> <p>Thanks for sharing. I had series of reflux and burps around age 25 when I had fried foods. I was diagnosed with gastritis. Intially PPI was helping. Then it did not work. Then .I start getting pain on right side rib whenever I eat fried foods, did hida scan and found my gallbladder not working and age 37 did ultrasound and found multiple gallstones and I also got barrets esophagus without dysplasia now. All these years I was suffering with lot of burping and bloating. Not sure if gallbladder or gastritis is the root cause . So haven&#39;t removed gallbladder yet.</p> Hi Gillian i am going to see the ENT specialist on Thursday. I have to say that since being on the low acid diet now for 5 weeks combined with omeprazole my symptoms have definitely improved. Not 100% by any means but seem to be getting better. Yes the acid watcher diet is quite American however the key for me was the ph values of the food. I\u2019ve stuck to it pretty religiously. I seem to be living off salad, potatoes, chicken, turkey, salmon, spinach, bananas, mango, papaya, parmesan, asparagus, broccoli, green beans, sprouts, almond milk, oatibix, kefir milk and only drinking water. I want to stick to this combination of low acid diet and omeprazole for 3 months and then stop the omeprazole. keep well Hi Anne Thanks for sharing. I will definitely let you know how it goes tomorrow with my ENT consultant. best wishes Thanks for posting Nick. Totally agree with your comments. I had my ENT consultation on Thursday. He put the camera thingy down my nose and was pleased to report nothing sinister down there therefore recommended I continue on the low acid diet combined with omeprazole for another 6 weeks and then go back and see him. I must say over the last couple of days my symptoms have improved a lot. I know it\u2019s a long road but feel the sacrifices could be paying off. sending positive thoughts to everyone for a symptom free day <p>Hello Everyone</p><p>I&#39;m from UK and in mid march i start facing hungry feeling in upper stomach and after having a food feeling start getting mild and sometimes feel absolutely fine but after couple of weeks start feeling pain at the same place went to GP&#160;</p><p>he advised to start omeprazol for 4 weeks 40 mg twice which helps and i stop using after 2 weeks.</p><p>3 weeks ago i had start bad soar throat spend week with gurgle and other home remedies but no cure then GP ask to do the course of antiobiotics for 10 days which helps but mild pain was still there.</p><p>I been to GP again 2 days ago and she says it looks like acid reflux so please start using omperazol again 40mg once a day for 4 weeks. sometime i also feel mild pain/hungry feeling in the upper stomach.</p><p>So Tcb9 ( sorry dont know your name) what do you think whether low acid diet help me as well? sometimes mild burning but no other symtoms. thanks</p><p>Your response would be appreciated. Cheers</p> Hi Tom Thanks for your advise. I already got the book and start diet since yesterday. but my anxiety and stress on peak and i belive this causes pain in stomach , indigestion , burning etc. I always thinking about acid reflux and this thing isnt come out of my mind :( <p> I purchased a booklet recently 30 - 30 days to heal your GERD. it says to eliminate all grains rice breads pastas because ultimately they sit in your stomach where it&#39;s warm and moist. then because there&#39;s not enough acid they ferment create a buildup of gas which then forces the esophagus sphincter to open and pushes the acid that is in your stomach up. </p>  so far the effects have been by removing grains and sugar, much less bloating and I dropped a bunch of weight. I noticed some longer times with no acid reflux But ultimately it has not gone away"

          "<p>Dear all</p><p></p><p>I have read with great interest many posts over the past couple of months with regards to LPR / Silent Reflux and I hope you don&#39;t mind me sharing my story. Even if nobody responds or reads this post at the very least, for me personally, writing this has been very therapeutic.</p><p></p><p>My story begins around early December 2017. It was actually my wife that pointed out to me that I was constantly clearing my throat. At first I thought it was just a sore throat and as such started taking the usual cough sweets, throat spray etc but it didn&#39;t seem to go away and indeed it started to get a bit worse. Constant clearing of my throat and also a strain like pain in my throat whenever I was talking. Eventually after Christmas I decided to go and see the GP who examined my throat etc. She said it looked a bit inflamed. She also did some blood tests and asked me to come back in a week for the results. At this stage she said it sounds like reflux but let&#39;s wait for the results.</p><p></p><p>I went back to see here a week later and the blood test was fine apart from the liver result which was higher than normal. She then asked about my drinking and I said that I drank a couple of glasses of red wine in the evening after work. That confirmed it for her. She said, in her opinion, it was acid reflux and the drinking was partly to blame. She gave me some omeprazole, 20g, to be taken 1 per day, and told me to cut back on the alcohol. I actually gave up completely and to begin with the symptoms seemed to disappear. I hadn&#39;t changed my diet at all at this stage. I finished the 28 day course of omeprazole and carried on as before minus alcohol.</p><p></p><p>This brings me up to early April when I decided to go back to see the GP. My throat was really painful when I spoke and the throat clearing was back with a vengeance. It was really affecting my work as i need to speak quite a bit to clients. I saw a different GP this time and he also said it was reflux but let&#39;s do a stool test just to make sure there is no infection in the stomach. That came back clear. He said no need to see a specialist. Take some more omeprazole and change your diet. It was at this stage, frustrated with the advice and guidance I was getting from my GP, I decided to do my own research. I did what I&#39;m sure all of you have done and googled the symptoms. Whoa!! Pretty scary what you find however I came across LPR and I thought that sounded exactly what I had. I read everything I could find on LPR and the general consensus seemed to be that a change in diet was absolutely essential. I found a good book online and decided to follow the eating plan. This was a massive change for me. It seemed as though just about everything I liked eating and drinking had to go. I started this diet on the 8th May 2018 and have now been on it for just over a month. The other thing that I read was that the most effective way to treat LPR was to suppress the acid as well as changing the diet therefore I have combined this with taking omeprazole for the last month. For sure there have been improvements. The throat clearing has almost gone and the pain when I speak, although still there, is not as bad and not there all the time. I feel as though it&#39;s moving in the right direction albeit very slowly. I do have some discomfort in my left ear. In fact the pain in my throat is on the left had side as well. I went back to see my GP last week as planned and she seemed pleased with progress. She did say it can take a while for the&#160;esophagus to heal. How long she didn&#39;t say. She has also suggested I see an ENT specialist just to be absolutely sure. That I am doing this week.</p><p></p><p>So here is what I have learnt over the last 6 months, in no particular order:-</p><p></p><p>- GP&#39;s are not experts on this. They seem to be quite happy to prescribe some PPI&#39;s and then send you on your way.</p><p>- There is so much conflicting information on the web. Eat this, don&#39;t eat this or eat that, no don&#39;t eat that. It was driving me crazy to an extent where I have basically stuck to some core foods over the past few weeks.</p><p>- I have been eating a lot healthier. Plenty of fruit (non acidic of course), veg, lean meat and only drinking water. That&#39;s probably been the hardest part. No tea or coffee. I&#39;ve also lost weight through a combination of no alcohol over last few months and the low acid diet over last month.&#160;</p><p>- These forums are excellent. Hearing from others with similar symptoms just gives you some comfort that you are not alone. I know everyone is busy but it would be great if people posted updates more often. One thing I noticed when reading one of the forum posts was that there was an initial steady stream of &#39;conversation&#39; which then seemed to suddenly stop.</p><p>- Everyone is different. What works for one person might not necessarily work for someone else. For example PPI&#39;s can work for some people and for others it can make the symptoms worse. Taking certain foods works for some and not for others.</p><p>- There definitely seems to be varying levels of suffering with LPR. Reading some of the stories on the forums makes me think my symptoms, although annoying and depressing for me, are not nearly as bad as other people. My heart goes out to everyone suffering with this.</p><p>- I haven&#39;t read anywhere online where someone has said they are completely cured. Hopefully there is and I&#39;ve just missed it.</p><p>- I couldn&#39;t find anything online to advise on how long the esophagus takes to heal.</p><p>- I tried [b]Gaviscon[/b] Advance and it didn&#39;t work for me.</p><p>- My symptoms seemed to get a bit worse whenever I had some wholemeal bread or even wholemeal pasta. My GP now wants to do another blood test to rule out wheat intolerance.</p><p>- This is a global problem. I live in the UK however have read many, many posts from fellow sufferers in the US and beyond.</p><p>- LPR is horrible and I want all of us to be rid of this awful affliction NOW!!</p><p></p><p>I&#39;m sure there are many more learnings and I could probably ramble on here all day however I better do some work. I am going to keep this post / blog whatever you want to call it updated as much as I can. If it helps even 1 person then it will be worth it.&#160;</p><p></p><p>Would be great to hear from other people. Please feel free to post or ask any questions. If I can help in any way I am happy to do so.</p><p></p><p>Best wishes to all</p><p></p><p>&#160;&#160;</p>"

          " Sounds like you've got a raging H. pylori infection, you need antibiotics for this. (If it's really really raging / painful) a Gastroscopy (an endoscope down the Throat and into the Stomach) to get an idea of it's true extent would be very helpful. If you are of modest means then some Generic Soluble Paracetamol could hit the spot, if you are a bit more minted then I'd go for Soluble Solpadeine Max,, do [b]not[/b] take Ibuprofen, Aspirin or Diclofenac (or any other NSAID), nor use any creams or gels containing these drugs... patient.info/health/Helicobacter-Pylori-and-Stomach-Pain.htm Look afters :) Thanku so much for your reply, however I was tested for h pylori virus two weeks ago my results came back last Friday saying negative for h pylori. Pain is worse than ever before today so have had to leave work and come home, I have docs appt at 4 and will ask to be referred as I thankfully have bupa ins, managed to get an appt with stomach specialist for tomorrow. Terrified it's something serious :-s  In that case then the Endoscopy is definitely the way to go. If you've been well in every other respect then I doubt it's anything 'serious', the worst it could be is a substantial Stomach Ulcer, they'll biopsy your Stomach when you have the Endoscopy (depending on how close they're taken from near the scabby bits the biopsies don't hurt) ;)  Thanku, I hope your right! Stomach pain has died down again now just feels bruised and tender, fingers crossed for my appt tomorrow! Will keep u posted  Ok so its been just over two weeks since my last post and this is whats been happening and where I am now... I went to the doctors on Friday 25/10 and got referred to a private hospital THANKFULLY (finding the nhs doctors not very helpful at all if im honest). So Saturday 26/10 I went and saw a stomach specialist, he listened to all my symptoms and what I had been going through and how long, I also told him about the Lansoprazole which wasn't working at all (which he said if its not working, stop taking it which I did), he examined my stomach (felt it) and booked me in for an Ultrasound which was on Wednesday 30/10 and an Endsocopy on Wednesday 06/11, he didn't comment on what it could be as he said he needed to run these tests first. I asked him what I could do for the pain in the mean time, he said he didn't know as he didn't know what was wrong, which is a fair comment but to maybe try paracetmol and see if that helps. So the pain in my stomach was still feeling horrendous, flaring up general mornings and afternoons to the point it would make me get extremely upset and not knowing what to do with myself, on Sunday 27/10 so much so I just said to my other half pls just look online and see what I can do to cope! I seriously didn't think I was going to make it to either of the coming appointments. I get upset stomach a couple of times a day too which added to the worry. He looked online and said it sounds like I have an ulcer so basically said to me to eat every 2 hours (little and often), stop drinking tea (I only have 4 a day anyway) so I have exchanged it for 3 green teas a day, I used to have 1 can of sprite in the evening with my dinner which I have stopped as you shouldn't drink fizzy drinks, I have stopped eating spicy foods, I used to smoke 5 cigarettes a day which I have reduced by 1 so now smoke 4 a day and only have one after eating... Long story short it this seems to of stopped my stomach flaring into mega pain however the pain is still there but luckily it enabled me to go to work etc. So I had the ultrasound, ALL CLEAR! which was a massive relief as I was petrified they was going to pick up something bad... he checked ALL my organs and said it all looks absolutely fine, which was a huge relief however they don't pick up stomach ulcers on an ultrasound so I still needed an endoscopy to see what was going on inside my stomach however the relief I had that the scan was all clear. So it felt like a week took forever to roll round until the Endoscopy, Wednesday 6th November was finally here, which I was extremely nervous about as the thought of having a camera down my throat into my stomach which was sooooooo painful was terrifying, my apt was at 3.15 and I wasn't allowed to eat for 6 hours before hand. I had the endoscopy under Sedation (which didn't fully work) however it didn't take them long to do it and the doctor and nurses were amazing and really put me at ease. To be honest I was just glad when it was all over, however my results were ALL CLEAR! No ulcer and from what he said my stomach all looked fine! Well in a way it was lovely to hear however what is this pain I have been getting! So as you can imagine I am no further forward really, my stomach is still extremely tender I feel sick all of the time, I have a lump in my throat I am eating and drinking all the right things (as far as im concerned) I have had the all clear on all tests so far WHAT DO I DO ? The consultant didn't have time to see me after the endoscopy, so now im booked in to see him on Monday 25/11 yes another two weeks away :( I am pinning so much on this apt, I can't surely live with this pain for the rest of my life, I don't want to go out or do anything its a struggle to come to work and I am just sick of not feeling well. The one thing that I have changed in my life since xmas is I started taking Asda's own A-Z Vitamins and Minerals, could I per allergic maybe? I stopped taking these on Thursday 07/11 however to date haven't noticed a difference in how I feel, how long should I leave it for to see if it is them? Other than that I just don't know :( All advise and comments gratefully received Hm funny that, based on what you were / are saying your Stomach should have something to um and ah at :| I know, I thought the exact thing, how can I have so much pain yet nothing be there? As I say the consultant didn't see me after like he was meant to and I have an apt with him Monday week, however I would of thought he would of told me something after the endoscopy? How much weight have you (unintentionally) lost [???] :)  Oh [:[] A nurse usually just gives you a tick box report after an Endoscopy (with your GP receiving a report in a few weeks), seeing the actual Consultant afterwards would be, er, unheard of, they're far too busy to talk to the mere punters ^_  I haven't lost or gained any weight I am exactly the same, as much as I feel sick I have been eating regularly (I am a creature of habbit anyway!) Well I went privately and when the I saw the consultant he said that I would have the endoscopy (by him) and then he would see me afterwards to tell me what he saw... however on the day the apt before me over over ran so I think that's why he had to shoot off hence why he booked me in to see him Monday week.  I'm not sure what is going on with you, but a few years ago I had unexplained gastritis that the doctors did not take seriously. Everything I ate caused nausea than diarrhea. I was losing a lot of weight and since I am already naturally underweight, I didn't have much to spare. I finally was prescribed marinol, which helped with keeping food down, but if I didnt take it the symptoms returned.. I eventually completely modified my diet and did a yeast cleanse (no sugar (grains) and certain yeast friendly foods) for 2 weeks. Then I went on the Paleo diet. My symptoms disappeared.. I don\u2019t know if this works for you.. but it sounds like you\u2019ve tried a lot of the harder stuff already. Hi Rose, Thank you for writing, How long did your gastritis go on for in total? Luckily I haven't been sick as yet even though I feel on the edge of being sick all the time, however I do get a constant upset stomach. The Paleo diet sounds interesting, have you stayed on that diet ever since? I am finding that since I have been eating every two hours (little and often) it has helped, however I still get upset stomach in the mornings and every early evening, strange as its generally always the same sort of time and mixing up what I eat doesnt' seem to change that either.  I stayed on the Paleo diet for 6 months. I had to stop because I got married, and my husband was not as supportive of my diet. It became too hard to continue it when the other person in the house continued questioning its effectiveness. I really believed that it helped though and always recommend it to anyone with stomach problems. When I stopped doing it, I was okay for about 4 months, then the symptoms started to come back.I struggle with gastritis occasionally now... So that would be 3 years now.. but of those three years I spent 18 months of it pregnant and 6 months of it on the diet. I did not have the symptoms when I was pregnant. I agree, smaller meals should help. You are making it easier on your digestive system when you eat smaller meals.  Jenny: My wife has twice had a similar problem to you. First time she was admitted to hospital and like you had all the tests. Nothing found t account for the pain. I suggested that she take Aloe Vera and after a few weeks it worked. When she had a follow up appointment the consultant was non committal about her remedy. He had some students with him and he asked her to wait until they discussed her case. We could hear them through the partition. One said that her mother had gone through a similar episode and had been helped by Aloe Vera. She commented that her mother said that it is expensive but worth it. Three years ago my wife had the same symptoms again and went through the same tests plus a CT scan. Again nothing was found. She has been taking Aloe Vera every day since. She has stopped it a few times when on holiday etc but has been glad to get back on to it so now takes capsules away with her."

          "I wondered if anyone could help me, since about January 2013 I have on and off had a dull ache in my stomach, sometimes flaring up to make me feel sick. I actually put this down to anxiety however in the past few weeks my theory has changed. About three weeks ago my stomach flared up however to the worst pain I have experienced as yet, made me feel like I was going to be sick constantly and made me not know what to do with myself. I feel like there is a lump in my thought and my stomach feels tender and swollen when flares up feels like my stomach is on fire/knotted up! The pain was so sever I went to the doctors (2 and a half weeks ago), my doctor felt my stomach and said it felt swollen, I told her the symtoms and she says she thinks I have gastritis and prescribed me with Lansoprazole 30mg tablets to take daily for 1 month, this however to date hasn't helped my stomach at all, the flare up comes and goes however the pain in my stomach is constant and the Lansorprazole is causing terrible upset stomach to the point I am worried to not be near a toilet. I went back to the doctors on Tuesday 22/10 explained all of the above to her and she said I am to keep taking the tablets and she is happy to see me again in November (once the months course has been taking) however im in dispear with this pain :( HAD ENOUGH OF FEELING ILL and can't help but think the worse Has anyone experienced symptoms same as above as I feel extremely on my own shouting and no one understanding what im going though Comments greatfully received."

          " I understand how hard it is, like you on the outside I seem ok, down, quiet but ok. Even friends can't tell sometimes, today my friend was upset because she didn't notice that I was having a panic attack, until I had to call her out of a meeting, because I needed help. We are all good at covering it up, and many of us have Years of practice. Is there anyone that you have near by that you can call on, I have only 1, so bless her she gets it all. I know it's so hard with all that goes on in your head, it's a struggle to work things out. I'm here if you need someone to talk,  Are you on any medication for depression? Your episodes of numbness do not sound psychological. I would want investigations into other possibilities. Have you been tested for vitamin B12 deficiency? This can result in neurological symptoms like you describe as well as serious depression and cognitive problems. Also some anti depressants can result in lack of sex drive and sensation, especially the SSRIs. Hi Claire, wow! You are fabulous at expressing yourself and have good communication skills.. I can empathise with inner/outer show/performance. I also struggle everyday. The strange thing is I am happy with most of my life and the future but still struggle with the basics. Life is hard but will get better. It does have meaning and purpose. <p>Hi Claire, how are you doing these days? I really hope you reply, it would help so much &lt;3</p> Never loose hope. Dont allow negative thoughts even if you have to struggle. God bless u! Go to deepest center of your consciousness as often as required. You are part of universe and loved one. dont over analyse your mind. go beyond mind, into simple peace. just be peaceful. dont compare with others. accept your self and love yourself. you are so good and adorable !!!  <p>I&#39;d love to talk to you if ypu are still feeling the same alot of what you said sounds exactly like the way I feel and even past relationships and my mother all sound alike yours. Your so good at explaining how your feeling. On a bad day I don&#39;t want to talk and on good days I cant explain the &quot;bad day&quot; feelings to an extent where I just sound like I&#39;m having a moan I&#39;ve so much in my life to look forward to but I can&#39;t be happy. I have a daughter and if she wasn&#39;t here I would be dead a long time ago. I wish there was some light at the end of the tunnel for me and I hope you found yours please reply if you can x</p>"

          "I just don't even know where to begin with this really. I just feel ultra lost in life and confused but most of all just terrified and I have long ago lost all motivation and any sense of hope or enjoyment in life. I feel I have lost all direction and my life feels completely out of my control. I am just existing and going along with whatever happens to me like a rag doll. I feel helpless in life like a child who is scared and has lost its mother - just so terrified. I am deeply embarrassed by this. I feel no sense of self worth, my confidence and self esteem is at its lowest ever .... life has passed me by and almost all of this time has been as a pathetic and hopeless cas. I have always been exceptionally sensitive and I always feel that I was not meant to be on this earth because somebody as weak as me just cannot survive here without self destructing or being destroyed by life's reality. I feel deeply ashamed of myself and my anxiety and depression. Completely pathetic and useless as a human being even though deep inside I also feel such a sense of sadness for myself like part of me still wants to reach deep and give me a big hug and save myself but I keep failing at this. I imagine I would excel in another type of land or in another world where I am just able to be in peace and the way I am and be left alone. I have already been through the days of finding small bursts of habits to keep me going - like playing computer games, or chatting online etc .... I have also been through under eating, over eating, binge eating, losing weight, gaining weight, not dressing, not washing, lying in bed - crying at the tiniest issues - worrying about worst case scenarios in life, and also feeling so completely lost as to what to do with myself. I get scared in life to the point of paranoia. I imagine the absolute worst will happen - getting into trouble, ending up in prison, ending up in a vulnerable situation, homeless, etc, etc, etc .... I find it really hard to trust myself, let alone other people because I feel I have no skills to cope in life. I feel tense around others and only peaceful when I am all alone in solitude .... but this is also very lonely and isolating place to be. I feel a source of guilt in terms of any relationship with my family - because they have not been able to help me - they have not been able to aid in my dysfunctional mind and circumstances. I have felt trapped, hysterical and like a I am verging on psychotic at times - shouting, throwing things, anger, tears. All this has already been and gone. I have visited psychologists in the past as well as psychiatrists - but they have never diagnosed me with anything else besides general depression and anxiety. And as I am particularly well able to articulate my feelings and problems lucidly and with intelligence then they do not realise the extent of my problem and the absolute unbearable sense of fears, paranoias, misery I feel inside I think. It's as though I have never fallen into any 'categor'y. I think this is because I have quite a variety of psychological difficulties that all merge into each other sometimes and of course feed off one another. Because I have managed to hang on (to all outward appearances) to some kind of sanity, they do not see the real picture of the chaos in my mind and body. I have suffered 3 strange 'episodes' in the last 15 years where I have lost sensation in my body and face and it has never returned. This remained something of a mystery to doctors and I was eventually diagnosed with some kind of neuropathy or anxiety related bodily symptoms. Physical manifestation of anxiety even though some of them argued my symptoms were not typical or fitting. These reduced sensations have never resolved or returned and I now live with reduced and diminished sensation including not being able to sense pleasure sensations like massages or orgasms, pain. I feel adverse to sex and always have - somehow I (sometimes) find it a bit dirty and repulsive and feel violated and I cannot live with how I feel because I feel like a freak to feel that way without any reason that I can recall. I have no history of abuse that I can recall - just an anxious mother with some depression and negativity in her own thinking. Apart from this I have just been scared since always and have never had the strength or courage to pull myself out and I am now at my worst point ever and have given up on life and am just existing. I have tried within my very limitied mental means to pull myself out by attempting life changes in the past but have been crippled by my own anxieties and fears and these attempts have ultimately ended in the same patterns of failure. I lack any sense of ability or life resources, no sense of strength and I am aimless in life - feeling as helpless as if I were a newborn. I do not see the meaning or point in anything and feel it so diffiult to think of anything that would make me want to see a glimmer of light and really try again. Been there, done that before. Already too tired. I feel like I want a parent figure to come guide me step by step and pull me out from this hole. But that is just ridiculous and the more I think of how I should be able to manage my life, the more ashamed I feel of my bleak and fearful reality. I now find myself in a very stressful situation in life currently. And I arrived here through my own desperation and hysteria to escape my last situation and lack of seeing any other way out - an out of the frying pan into the fire situation. I have tried in the past medication, cbt, citalopram medication ..... I am so sad that I have come to this point but I do not know how to get better or where to begin ..... so much seems to have happened inside my mind that I am genuinely afraid that I have gone quite mad (but am still managing to pretend to be sane) ... I cannot cope with the vast amount of emotions and their intense strength that I feel in terms of everything seeming so dark, desperate, scary, chaotic and my mind just can't process it all. Particularly it just all feels a lot of thoughts for a tiny tiny mind to have. I just thought I would write about it. I have been through a lot of weird phases, living on baby food for a while, labelling the calories on everything, Obsessive tendencies to tidy everything to the extreme just to have an element of control in my life .... I have a problem with OCD where everything in my home has to be perfect and tidy and straight otherwise I feel very anxious and restless and as though things are dirty or that I have lost all control completely. If I lose the ability to control even my home or food then I feel I will have absolutely nothing since the rest of my life is so far gone. But the pressure this extreme thinking gives me is unbearable to live with and makes me tired and cry when I don't match up to my own pressure and standards. I take ages to get ready every day on the days when I feel able to try and go out because I feel I have to put on a pretence of appearing respectable and 'ok' .... the reality is sometimes I cry, shout, like a toddler who can't handle adult life and who can't dress herself or manage her well-being and life. Afraid. Lost. Unmotivated. My mind wants it all to go blank. I want peace. Feel a complete loser in life. Just want to float away quietly on a cloud or sleep and not wake up sometimes and just drift off into a haze where the last thing I think about is something uplifting and peaceful and far from the reality of this overwhelming life. I feel guilty to myself and to the world for being this way. The only way my stupid dreamy mind sometimes justifies it is to pretend I am a fairy from another world who was made perfectly but has come to an imperfect world and cannot hack it because it's too far from my own world. And I imagine this particular thought in a sane way, not an insane way ... I realise I am not really this person but this is the best way I am able to get any comfort in how I feel in this life."

          " <p>Hi Kate and thank you for this excellent post. I too, have been suffering with anxiety since I was a child so many years ago. I remember my first &#39;panic attack&#39; like it was yesterday. It was 45 years ago. It has been a mission for me to sort it all out. I looked at the mental aspects and tried to meditate, which helped me a great deal for a period of three years. It was only when I was in deep meditation that I realized how tense and anxious I truly was. The calmness I felt during that first experience of meditation was so beautiful it made me laugh out of pure joy. I found a tool that I could use on a daily basis to combat the fear and tension that anxiety had created in my life untill then. The day came after my father&#39;s passing that meditation was not working for me as it once did. It became impossible to continue to use this tool effectively. On to searching for supplements and nutrition to fight this ugly monster. I search and experimented with hundreds of nutritional supplements, some had a positive effect, most did not. It was not helping like meditation had. At 68 years old, after years of searching for answers, I gave in. Citalopram. It has been 17 days on this med and it has been a roller coaster ride of side effects ranging from gastrointestinal discomfort to severe anxiety. I can finally say I &#160;seem to be in a better place and improving more and more wirh each passing day. I have hope which I thought was lost forever. I thank my Doctor for prescribing my first ever SSRI and am proud of myself for taking the plunge, so to speak. My future is bright and for that I am very grateful.&#160;</p> <p>Wow...Kate I have never read any of those books or any book...but I understand fully what you are talking about.so well explain...I learn thru reading your reply/comments..to do exactly that ..let them be ...but I couldn&#39;t do that without celexa..with celexa it&#39;s so easy...without celexa ..it was a nightmare...great post..take care</p>"

          "<p>Someone asked if I&#39;d share this in a public post (this is from a private message we had).</p><p></p><p>As well as taking Citalopram, I found understanding about anxiety was a big breakthrough for me and helped me recover.</p><p></p><p>Years ago I read all of Dr [b]Clare Weeks[/b] books and it was the first time someone had actually made anxiety seem so simple to understand. &#160;I wanted my doctor and medical team to talk to me the way she talked to her patients but they didn&#39;t back then. &#160;I was frightened of the word &#39;mental&#39; and wasn&#39;t comfortable having therapy, which was carried out in a cold, unwelcoming victorian hospital, and the whole experience just made me more anxious and frightened than ever. &#160;I knew I wasn&#39;t mad, I just had this feeling that I didn&#39;t understand, these thoughts that brought this feeling on and nobody once told me it was anxiety. &#160;Never. &#160;One doctor suggested I had Obsessional Neurosis, another said depression - was I neurotic? &#160;What were all these feelings, why did I have them, where do I go ........ these thoughts churned around my head daily, adding to my anxiety, strengthening those frightening thoughts ....... and I found the answer in those books ..... I had anxiety. &#160;Everything I felt and thought was all due to anxiety. &#160;Fix the anxiety and the rest would be fixed too. &#160;Simple. &#160;Though it wasn&#39;t that simple getting out of it.</p><p></p><p>But just knowing that sorted all the confusion out in my head and instead I could just concentrate on one thing. &#160;I see many people doing what I did - always searching for an answer, panicking and questioning every symptom, they get confused and go round in circles searching for an answer - just as I had done. &#160;The answer for me was in those books (plus the other newer book I found this year and I can&#39;t mention here). &#160;To me, they were simple answers - and a simple route back to normality - though that simple route was not easy.</p><p></p><p>Those books talked about sensitisation which I found interesting.</p><p></p><p>When you suffer with stress over and over, your nerves become a little sensitive over time. &#160;This means that they start to become &#39;trigger happy&#39; and emotions start to become more exaggerated. &#160;Your nerves cannot sustain this sensitivity forever and needs time to calm every so often ...... but what do we do? &#160;... we continue to push ourselves more, add more stress and make our nerves more and more sensitive, pushing and pushing them until they can&#39;t cope anymore until they break down, resulting in an outpouring of adrenaline and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>For a &#39;normal&#39; person, if they&#39;d had that anxiety feeling they&#39;d be able to cope with it, but to a person that&#39;s been working those nerves to the maximum and feeling those emotions more and more, they will probably respond to the anxiety differently - with fear.</p><p></p><p>So our nerves are now screaming at us - the heart is pounding, we sweat, shake, and the anxiety is raging around our bodies and we feel absolutely terrified of all these new feelings. &#160;We are over reacting to a physical feeling, but our emotions are already exaggerated, our bodies tense and alert and we start to fear this. &#160;Our body is super sensitised .......... everything we feel and think is over exaggerated. &#160;We hold our bodies tensely, fighting this &#39;thing&#39;, we clench our teeth, hold our stomaches tight ........ it is so tiring.</p><p></p><p>We simply need to reverse this, to bring this sensitisation back down to normal, and that is by relaxing towards the anxiety, release the tension on the stomach, release that clenched jaw, ....... just let go of tension and float along. &#160;We should not react to the anxiety with tension, not fear it ....... and this will in time make our nerves calmer, soothing them so eventually they&#39;ll return to normal which will then bring all our reactions back to normal too.</p><p></p><p>The body needs a rest. &#160;We rush about and hold it so tight against fear which adds to the problem. &#160;If you held a heavy weight for a long time then your muscles would soon tire and would scream at you they wanted to rest. &#160;This is the same about tensing to anxiety. &#160;Stop rushing about, slow down, let go of those tense / tight muscles, relax, slump ....... but don&#39;t just sit there, but instead whilst relaxing you must at the same time carry on about your day as normal. &#160;Slowly.</p><p></p><p>This is why &#39;normal&#39; people don&#39;t have this reaction to anxiety because their nerves are at a normal level. &#160;When your nerves are heightened they will respond to anything and everything - its like they&#39;re alive and buzzing around your body.</p><p></p><p>Along with medication, helping to treat anxiety is to first understand that everything you think and feel are all due to anxiety. &#160;All the &#39;what if I did this&#39;, &#39;what if my anxiety doesn&#39;t go&#39;, &#39;what if I&#39;m this&#39; and &#39;what if I&#39;m that&#39; ........ all these questions and many more that go round and round in your head all day creating more anxiety, and questions that are never answered. &#160;I had my fair share of them. &#160;People start to avoid things and places because they feel anxious - but it isn&#39;t these places they fear, but it is the fear itself they fear. &#160;They fear that feeling so avoid places because they know they&#39;ll feel it there ...... and so the association with places starts.</p><p></p><p>Its the same with scary thoughts. &#160;We fear our thoughts, and so our mind goes looking for more. &#160;They produce anxiety and so we then try to avoid these thoughts which just exaggerates them. &#160;We should instead let those thoughts be there, let them flit in and out, relax towards them and carry on with whatever we&#39;re doing. &#160;The anxiety will build up but it will also pass too. &#160;Over time ..... much time ..... your body slowly becomes desensitised to the place, thought or whatever it is and relearns not to be frightened. &#160;You&#39;re reversing the process.</p><p></p><p>It was this that I began to understand. &#160;For a very long time though I couldn&#39;t get started on this as I expected to feel relief immediately. &#160;I&#39;d think &#39;but I let those thoughts come and go and they still frighten me&#39; ......... but I didn&#39;t understand that yes they would still frighten me, but I had to let them, relax, carry on. &#160;It wasn&#39;t until I started taking SSRI&#39;s that it all began to fit together and I could see what Dr Weeks meant, could see it was just anxiety I had and how to relax towards my fears. &#160;Yes the medication helped me recover but I think 16 years of anxiety I just couldn&#39;t do it with just a book back then as I had too many habits to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Anxiety is physical. &#160;Nerves are physical and they become &#39;jagged&#39;. &#160;They just need to become smoothed out again. &#160;</p><p></p><p>Take away the hurdle of the constant questions, there is no need to over analyse each symptom ...... they are all there purely because you have anxiety. &#160;Once the anxiety starts to ease, so to will all those symptoms - so why waste time trying to sort them out.</p><p></p><p>Nurture the body with good food and gentle exercise too.</p><p></p><p>Take life at a slower pace - we all are so used to rushing everywhere, fitting things in - and its good for us for a while. &#160;Too much pushing it and those nerves start to get overworked.</p><p></p><p>Just slow down and let go throughout your day. &#160;Nobody can see anxiety coming and you won&#39;t know until is too late and you get your first panic attack or taste of anxiety. &#160;When that starts its quite shocking as we don&#39;t ever feel anything like it so that&#39;s why it becomes frightening. &#160;Those sensitised nerves will make you over exaggerate everything and they just need to be reversed.When the Citalopram started to kick in, I found understanding all this just helped sort the jumbled mess in my head. &#160;I found one path to follow, I didn&#39;t need to question anything anymore as knew all the symptoms would ease along with the anxiety.</p><p></p><p>They did.</p><p>&#160;</p>"

          " Thanks for this Erica!!! Firstly thank you so much for telling your positive story about GB surgery, brilliant. I too have had the same symptoms and am going for surgery as i want my life back, your story is so similar to mine, it has taken me two years to get this far, hundreds of visits to GPs etc only to be told it is IBS, acid reflux etc, my tests eventually have show only 35% function of GB - at last like you I hope for a great result !!! Very best wishes and thank you. <p>Hi I have post op booked this coming Monday and having GB removed June 28th. Very nervous. Pain in right lower rib area be glad to be rid of. Don&#39;t get bad attacks as controlled with diet. Just very nervous of op but know I have to have it. </p><p>I try not to read negative talk need to read more positive stories. </p> <p>I agree that it would be nice to have more success stories so that you would feel better about having your gallbladder removed. It is scary to come here before surgery. But a lot of us aren&#39;t as fortunate to feel better as you think you should after surgery. And it&#39;s nice to have a forum like this for support. I had my surgery over two months ago and as I&#39;m writing you right now I have a terrible stomach ache that is going on on out 22 hours. Pretzels brought it on. I have no problem with fatty foods although I stay away from them now because I&#39;ve started a new diet for weight loss. Can&#39;t eat cereal or oatmeal but fine with wheat bread. Yes it takes some adjusting to what you can&#39;t eat especially when it&#39;s things that others don&#39;t seem to have a problem with. We are all different. </p><p>So I&#39;m so happy for you that you had a successful experience and feel much better as I&#39;m sure many people have. But for those who haven&#39;t they need support.?</p> <p>Positive surgery story for you &#128522;</p><p>I&#39;m 10 days post op from keyhole surgery to remove my gallbladder. I read a lot of posts of negatives after surgery so wanted to say how well mine has gone. </p><p>I was terrified going in as I&#39;ve never had an operation before, but I&#39;m so thankful it&#39;s all done. </p><p>Went into theatre approx 10:30 am and woke up in recovery at 11:20. Did have pain coming around but that was quickly dealt with, thanks to morphine. Taken back to the ward absolutely desperate for a cup of tea, they made me drink water first to make sure I wasn&#39;t sick (I wasn&#39;t) I then had 3 cups of tea and a lovely pack of chicken and mayo sandwiches which I devoured &#128514; I was up and wandering around the ward shortly after my food. </p><p>Obviously there was discomfort but I found no need for any pain medication. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve got a particularly high pain threshold so was very surprised how little pain I was in. Possibly after having such bad gallbladder attacks nothing else quite comes close to that pain. </p><p>I was kept in overnight just so they could monitor my urine as I was drinking more than I was urinating but my bladder slowly came back to life. </p><p>I&#39;ve been home resting ever since, I&#39;m stiff and sore after lying down too long but that soon gets better once up and moving around. My wounds are healing nicely and not causing me much bother apart from I&#39;m worrying about catching them in clothes so I&#39;m loosely covering them when I&#39;m dressed just to make me feel happier. </p><p>I&#39;ve been eating normally, with no bowel issues. I&#39;m still doing pretty low fat as it&#39;s hard to change habits I&#39;ve become used to due to gallbladder attacks but I enjoyed a chicken curry last night with chips, fried rice and prawn crackers (big no no for me before op) and I&#39;ve had no adverse symptoms at all. </p><p>I&#39;ve been for a small walk today which has worn me out a little but it will take time for my body to heal. All in all I&#39;m so over the moon it&#39;s all done and I just need to take it slowly Day by day &#128522;</p><p>Hope I&#39;ve helped put some minds at rest and good luck anyone due for surgery x</p> <p>Hi Erica</p><p>Whilst I&#39;m pleased you are doing well and it&#39;s good to have posts of positive outcomes, not all posts here are negative. </p><p>I and several others who post regularly try to support those who have issues. If I feel I can help someone, I post.</p><p>I have quoted several times that five friends who&#39;ve had their gallbladders out have done well since with no problems.</p><p>There are people trying all sorts of medically unproven remedies and trying to control symptoms with a low fat diet instead of having the surgery they need. I have told my story many times now in order to try and persuade people to have surgery. Once you have a gallstones diagnosis and are getting attacks nothing but surgery will make those gallstones disappear, as you&#39;ve discovered.</p><p>Leaving the stones in there can lead to all sorts of problems.</p><p>Having my cholecystectomy (open surgery) has probably saved my life as they discovered I had early gallbladder cancer and I was able to have a liver resection. Most gallbladder cancers aren&#39;t caught in time. I will have to be monitored for five years, but I&#39;d say my experience has been very positive.</p><p>Like you, I am about three months post op and feeling better than I have in years. I can eat more or less what I like, though fatty foods still scare me. I&#39;ve had practically no diarrhoea. I have been able to come off my meds for high BP, due to having lost 3.5 stones in weight. I still have some uncomfortable tenderness in my right side where my gallbladder was but I did have two major surgeries using the same incision within five weeks. It&#39;s nothing compared to the pain I had which lingered on for 3 or 4 days at a time leaving me exhausted.</p><p></p> <p>I am glad that your surgery was successful. I believe that you went on this site to encourage others, because your experience was positive. &#160;It is good that you listened to your own body and went ahead with the surgery. &#160;</p><p></p><p>There are many, many factors that contribute to a good outcome, such as the health of the patient, the skill of the doctor and surgeon and the ability of the body to recover. &#160;Bellieve it or not, some of the outcome depends on whether one is lucky, or not. &#160;</p><p></p><p>People come to this site to share. &#160;They share practical knowledge, seek comfort and offer support. &#160;Others do have negative experiences, for which medicine is seldom capable of offering a remedy. &#160;These are the patients that the doctors prefer to avoid and prentend don&#39;t exist. &#160;They are the ones who have been told that their very real medical problems are &quot;all in their head.&quot; &#160;</p><p></p><p>I hope that in your life you never experience this. &#160;But you do others who have such an experience by characterizing their posts as negative. &#160;&#160;&#160;</p> Excuse me, I meant to say: But you do others who have such an experience an injustice by characterizing their posts as negative.  <p>Thank you all for your replies. There is a lot of negative on this forum. That doesn&#39;t mean the negative isn&#39;t true. My post says please don&#39;t let the negative scare you out of what could possibly be great! It&#39;s unfortunate that not everyone has the same outcome but its also unfortunate that you don&#39;t see more positive stories on here as well. Can be very discouraging</p> <p>Hi Erica, it&#39;s fantastic to hear your success story. I too know loads of people who have had the op and are leading normal life again. I know there are, I won&#39;t call it negative feedback but it is from people who are scared and worried about their condition and reading stories like yours definately makes a difference. My husband had open surgery due to adhesions from previous car accident ,he had suffered may years discomfort etc.However, he did need second op 5 days later ,and the reason for this I have now found is that the lack of communication between staff. They started to give him food when his bowels had not started working so the food just sat in there and of course caused a blockage. I took him to another hospital where they are doing it correctly and not feeding him until his bowels start to work. If anyone who reads this please remember it is important to have your gallbladder removed if it is causing you a problem, it is a very easy op and you will definately benefit you.</p><p>&#160;</p> <p>Hi Erica. Thank you for sharing! I&#39;ve searched the internet looking for someone with similar symptoms to mine. I also had normal CTs, ultrasounds, labs. Only a polyp that none of the doctors thought would be causing my symptoms, which was mostly that dull pain that was constant, no matter what I ate, or if I even ate at all. Mostly in the epigastric region, but sometimes left or right side. I had an endoscopic ultrasound which showed my pancreas and ducts were fine. But my HIDA scan showed 31%, and after my own doctor wasn&#39;t sure that this would be causing my symptoms, I spoke to a surgeon who was confident it was. I&#39;m now 10 days post op, and my question to you is, how long did it take you to feel normal again? And what were some things you experienced along the way? Can you explain what your recovery was like? I keep reading stories of people who were back to themselves in two days or so, and it&#39;s been making me a little nervous.&#160;</p>"

          "Let me start out by saying [b]DO NOT LISTEN TO ALL OF THESE NEGATIVE POSTS ON HERE![/b] The internet says that Gallbladder surgery is the most [b]COMMON [/b]surgery in todays world and about 700,000 people in the United states have their gallbladder taken out each year. So please do not let a couple of hundred negative posts on the internet scare you away from doing something that could change your life for the better! People who have a positive outcome do not post their results, they are too busy enjoying their life now that they feel better! For 10 years I suffered and I finally hit my breaking point. The Gallbladder surgery was the first surgery I ever had so just like many of you, I was on these websites every chance I got searching for a reason to believe this was my answer and that I was doing the right thing. Unfortunately, all I found were all these horror stories and people with complications. My CT scan, Ultrasound, Labs etc all came back fine. I had no gallstones. My Hida scan was 33%, which as many of you know, can be a tricky number when it comes to a Doctor believing that the gallbladder is the problem. Especially in my case where symptoms were not typical gallbladder symptoms. Pain was not always on the right side, it was mostly in the center above my ribs, my pain was not always after a fatty meal, it was with [b]EVERY [/b]meal. I did not have a ton of heartburn. IBS medications, both prescription and over the counter, natural supplements, food/ingredient elimination\u2026it helped, but only temporarily. But I know my body, and their answers weren\u2019t good enough for me. I finally decided to see a surgeon for a second opinion, and then the option was up to me. It took me 2 months to decide that I was going for it. I read every single article online that you can find that relates to gallbladder removal, and every single post on these forum websites, both good and bad. I am now just about 3 months post op and I feel amazing. Of course you have to watch what you eat now and avoid certain foods, but to be honest, it\u2019s all stuff you\u2019re used to by now if you\u2019ve suffered stomach issues before getting your gallbladder out. My gallbladder was covered in scar tissue when they removed it, with some cholesterolosis. One thing I noticed after the surgery is that the dull horrible pain that I had [b]ALWAYS [/b]felt in my stomach is now gone. When you feel that way for [b]THAT [/b]long, it almost feels weird [b]NOT [/b]to feel like that anymore. But I felt so relieved. I still do. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still have days where I feel a bit bloated and I\u2019m still learning what I\u2019m sensitive to, but it\u2019s a different kind of bloat, and the blah feeling I sometimes get now would not even come close to what I felt before the surgery. I\u2019m all for the questions, so please ask. Just remember that just because you don\u2019t have \u201cclassic gallbladder symptoms\u201d doesn\u2019t mean its not your gallbladder!"

          " hi i had my gallbladder removed in 1990 and have had problems with the bowel ever since. but apart from my very closest family i never spoke about it until last year 2011 in december i had a sehcat test done and was diagnosed with bile salt malabsorption i also have b12 anemia which i think is connected has it is the same site that both are absorbed in. my own research through the net. but even if i was told that i would end up with permanent bowel problems i would still of had the operation because i was ill in the end. 21yrs i suffered in silence due to embarrassment what an idiot i was i feel better just knowing my accidents are not my fault im only 44yrs old now, so i suppose the older you get the less you are willing to leave things ,i think that the ratio of people left with problems after gallbladder removal is alot higher than what is recorded it is just hard to speak about when you are young sorry for the ramble finely ive come to terms with this all the best to you . yes i put weight on after and have never managed to loose it again and im busy,i go walking the gym and swimming. just easier not to eat if going somewere,so as not to have an accident wether this makes the weight worse probably does metabolism an all that. I also have this condition, but I loose weight not gain it, we are all different, not sure if you great people are aware of the help with toilets if you need them, here are a few I have found :- The National Key Scheme (RADAR) gives you access to public toilets for disabled people throughout the country. These are very useful and you can buy a key by visiting their website at www.radar.org.uk NACC - Card \u00a3 12.00 for the pack www.nacc.org.uk/content/home.asp phone apps to find a toilet - www.betomorrow.com/2011/09/02/ou-sont-les-toilettes/ free hope this helps I had my gallbladder removed 2 yrs ago. I've had constant problems with my bowel ever since. I haven't lost weight, I've gained it. Some weeks have diarrahoea other times I am constipated. Been told its a side effect of the op. Some people get better others don't. I just got presribed Colestyramine for this condition .. early days but seems to be helping so far as it helps with the absorption so that food doesn't pass through quite as quickly! Might be worth talking to your doctor about it. There is more than one reason why people have body parts, namely a gall bladder and doctors play with peoples lives as if they are dealing with mechanical objects taking things out of peoples body and not replacing them. Doctors and scientists can do anything these days but they dont want to create an artificial gall bladder with all its entire functions because it will cost them money. On the other hand they can create artificial hearts and valves - who are they to judge what organs people need or dont need. They tell you that you dont need your gall bladder but as you all know it from experience, you do. If all the people took some action we would all go a long way. They could just take out the stones just like they do from a kidney without unecessarily removing it and do the same with the gall bladder and stitch it up inside but nooo, they want to be efficient and save money.....by making patients, you suffer. As you can see the gall bladder is a very important organ, apart from the usual it also has bowel and weight regulation function, it has an affect on hormones and other body parts. After the doctor has done his job in theatre, which is not to cure the problem but to make it worse, which they wont admit to, are the side effects you suffer from this surgery. They usually do not have an answer to your problems after the operation. They will give 101 excuses and blame other things or your other perfectly healthy system. They will not want to admit the side effects are true nor will they want to deal with it anymore. The short answer is you have stones, take out the whole thing. Has it not occured to anyone with an average intellience, you need your gall bladder and removing it is not the answer. Even when the gall bladder is removed you continue to accumulate stones. The problem is not the gall bladder. The problem is diet - you need more fibre and water and eat healthy. If you dont do that you're liver will get congested and as result bile flowing from the liver will be sluggish and if there is not enough water and too much of the wrong type of waste it will harden and turn to stone. The liver and diet is the cause of gall bladder disease not the gall bladder and removing the gall bladder wont do any good but to make problems worse. The main problem is if the gall bladder is removed bile will flow down through the digestive systen and into the bowels, over time, this will cause irritation and will get worse which will result in bowel problems. Patients need to do everything to get a replacement gall bladder if they opt to have it out otherwise go for conservative treatment, if a lot of pressure is applied on the doctors they will do what you want them to. i also had my gallbladder removed back in 2011,and last june was diagnosed with Bile salt malabsorption. looking back i think i may have had it beforehand,but having my gallbladder removed just made the symptoms alot worse.i went from constantly going the toilet to living my whole day running up and down the stairs going at least 20 times a day. now im finding i have put weight on, although i follow a very healthy diet,eating alot of fresh fruit and veg,using the slimming world diet, i go to the gym at least 3 times a week,i dont drive so walk everywhere,nd go to aqua fit,yet i cant lose weight no matter how hard im trying. i have been on colystyramene since last june so symtoms are now under control but feel im not getting anywhere.

          " Hi Julie, thank you,for such a comprehensive post. I have recently had the LINX PROCEDURE and like,you I'm feeling fantastic, my surgeon is one of the best upper GI consultants in Europe Mr Wajed at the royal Devon & Exeter hospital i was offered LINX after many and lengthy tests and the critaria is so very strict. The nissen flux was mentioned but to be honest it frightened me for all the reso s you say, I also spoke to at least half a dozen people who had had it done and they all experienced problems, I totally agree it's down to th surgeon and to a lesser extent the patient, were all different. What scared me ref the procedure you had was how they hitch the stomach over the easophogus and also the inability to ever throw up I'm soooooo lucky I was able,to have the LINX procedure and he also repaired a 3 cm HH Were both lucky it worked for us and hopefully we can help others who are maybe in the same position we were in prior to our respective procedures paul x Julie, what a wonderfully positive report. Bless you. I'm so glad you are celebrating that good health that has been in at least part now returned to you. It's funny. When I first came on these boards I was haunted by the many nay-sayers and the tales of horror that I continually read. I was fearful of having an endoscopy. I was literally shaking when I had my blood pressure in preparation for the same because of all that I had read here and elsewhere. I was convinced I had something deadly. I must - I thought- given what I had read. As it turned out IN REALITY I didn't. I was fine. I was certainly much more relaxed when I had the colonoscopy largely because I knew better than to read - or believe - those ever multipling horror stories. I prepared myself in a positive fashion on that occasion and was much better for it. As you suggest, dear Julie, mind-frame makes a vast difference and I think - in part - only YOU can doctor yourself in that regard. FORGET THE DRUGS AND POTIONS. Certainly THAT proved true to me - and I can only share my own experience. Now, whilst it is true that all of my initial reporting symptoms have not disappeared entirely - albeit many have - I find I can now live happily aside them because I have become accepting of myself and continue to maintain a positive attitude. The deficits may occasionally be disturbing, yes, but not life threatening and certainly nothing that I can't handle. There is, I have found, great succour found in the power of positive thought. I sometimes wish there could be more of that hereabouts. Bless you, Julie, for providing your own brilliant evidence of that same. It gives great value to an ever burgeoning many.  Hi Julie, really interested to read your post, I have seen my surgeon today and am booked in for a partial nissen fundiplication, probably within the next month. I have a hiatus hernia and now barretts, have been on Omeprazole for 10 years looking forward to coming off this medication! How long did you have off work following this procedure? Did you lose much weight following the surgery? My surgeon is concerned that I don't lose too much weight he said I am a very slim lady so mustn't lose too much. One thing I am concerned about is the inability to vomit afterwards, how do you prevent this if you get a bug and what could happen? I absolutely hate throwing up but the thought of not being able to when your body wants to scares me! Brilliant account of the surgery. Did they say how long it may last? I had the same procedures in 2007 but have had some savage reflux lately and my oesophagus is inflamed again. I'm in hospital just now waiting for a barium swallow. I would not hesitate to have the procedure again. It changed my life very much for the better. What did you feel like after one week, reason for asking is, I am having the same op and 8 days later I have something in my calendar I don't want to miss, so will I be able to just sit there. So glad you have recovered well after your op and thank you for your input Can I just advise caution. A friend of mine - a close friend - had this procedure a year ago. Her reflux came back quite quickly and she three times went back to the operating consultant. He assured her that wasn't possible. The GP put her back on medication. Then she found she was having laboured breathing. They gave her a CT scan recently and a large HH had reopened leading to the development of a rapidly deteriorating situation with her lungs that is life threatening. They now need to schedule re-constructive surgery. I really would not have this procedure unless it is ABSOLUTELY neccessary. My friend had it ... and it may well have cost her life. Not pretty. They have suggested she now has three years ... with potentially the need for a lung transplant. Given her age (65+) she will not be a priority for that. "

          "I had suffered with stomach problems for what felt like forever but was probably just a year or two before I finally insisted on seeing a specialist (Nov 13). I have previously been taking Esmaprazole, Domperidone and copious amounts of Gaviscon to no real avail. I suffered acid problems and a constant burning sensation in my upper abdomen. I had Laparscopic Nissen Fundoplication and Hiatal Hernia repair surgery in June 2014 and could feel the improvements from the moment I came round from Anaesthetic. I thoroughly researched the surgery, recovery and surgeon\u2019s available and even considered paying privately if the need required. By request I was referred to Mr Viswanath (James Cook University Hospital & Nuffield Hospital \u2013 North East England). After reading some of the blogs and information available on the Internet regarding this type of surgery I was under no illusions that the recovery would be very tough, Indeed my own GP advised me against this type of operation as did most of my family and friends however the pain and suffering was to such an extent that I knew I had little option but to undergo surgery. I am very pleased to say that for me, the recovery has been less difficult/painful than I was advised, I put this down to two factors; firstly and most importantly the skill of the surgeon, secondly by being mentally prepared (remember that any discomfort and dietary restrictions after the operation are a temporary measure in order to fix your stomach, and by comparing that to the constant discomfort I was suffering Pre-Operation encouraged me to be positive each and every day). I had never before experienced a hospital stay or surgery or anaesthetic and was very nervous however I can honestly say (to date) the hardest part for me was the thorough testing carried out to check if I was suitable for surgery and also the 24 hour fasting/dietary restrictions pre-op (an empty stomach for me was a truly painful thing - the acid was unbearable). My surgery was first of the day and I was given the anaesthetic at 07:50, When I awoke from anaesthetic at 10:50 I was asked how I was feeling etc and if I was in any pain/discomfort, I wasn\u2019t and asked for some water which I was given at hourly intervals on an incremental basis. After my first sip of water I managed a small burp (for me this was a major sign of the surgery\u2019s success, I had read many blogs in which people were never able to burp again and therefore suffered from gas). I wasn\u2019t in any pain/discomfort nor felt groggy in any way, in fact the constant nagging pain that I had felt pre op was gone. I managed to visit the ladies without any assistance walking and was discharged shortly after 17:30pm the same day. Amazing!! Unfortunatly another lady in for surgery the same day as me was not so lucky, when she awoke she asked for pain medication and when I left she was still struggling to swallow even the smallest amount of fluid. (I put this down to the pain medication but I\u2019m not medically trained and am not qualified to say). I was discharged with Tramadol pain killers to be taken as required alongside paracetamol, anti-sickness medication and Lanzaprazol (all dispersible). I took half of the Tramadol on the second day thinking it would help me sleep as I was finding it difficult to get comfortable lying down because of the wounds, but it didn\u2019t and so I didn\u2019t take any more. The first few days I took paracetamol every four hours along with the anti-sickness and Lanzaprazol but around day 5 I didn\u2019t feel the need and only kept taking the antacid at doctors instructions (so the stomach has time to heal without acid causing any problem). Food was limited to liquid only and I admit to following the dietary information very comprehensively (My advice if you want it - this is your chance to fix your stomach \u2013 don\u2019t waste it by trying to run before you can walk). I kept a daily log of my food intake and although the first few days I managed very little, a small amount of yoghurt, ice cream and soup this soon increased as the week/weeks went on and the food diary helped me to monitor the improvement easily \u2013 which also helped boost my moral/positive attitude. Although a liquid diet sounds very restrictive, a little preparation can go a long way to making this diet easier and more acceptable. I made several batches of soup pre op, different flavours and thickness and froze them in different quantity pots \u2013 labelling them clearly, I bought several types/flavours of ice cream, and yoghurt\u2019s and also drinks e.g Bovril, Hot Chocolate, Ovaltine and Horlicks and used full fat milk. I bought various tins of deserts e.g Custard, Semolina, Tapioca, rice pudding and thinned these down with full fat milk. By week 3 I was managing small amounts of soup with small bits and also a rusk with a cup of tea. After week 6 I stopped recording my food intake and continue to increase my intake on a slow and steady basis. I\u2019m not saying the recovery has been easy and there were/are times when it is difficult to swallow food and I know I still have a way to go, it\u2019s still early days and as my intake is reduced so is my energy levels but in all I would say this was not as difficult and unpleasant as I had thought, and for me it was a big success and my life is much better for it. I am thrilled with the results to date (11 weeks on). I would like to mention that I am pleased with the service received from the National Health Service, from the point of referral, through consultations and thorough testing to the date of my surgery took under 7 months. I couldn't fault the care received. Again I would mention the skills of Mr Viswanath and his team in helping to give me back my health. My advice to anyone suffering - If surgery is a viable option for you then do your research & choose your surgeon, remain positive and follow the instructions given to aid your recovery. Don't be put off by the information available, there are success stories too. Best Wishes, Julie."

          " One correction. I wrote my son had 9 cm shaved off from his muscle fibers in his LES, but that might be wrong. It might be 9 mm. Will ask the doctor in about three weeks. That's when he has his post operative doctor visit. i had my op november 2011 and the problem i have now is i cant even lose weight not even a few lbs - my gp told me this is normal for the first few years after surgery as my body is still in recovery mode.  Thank you for telliong your son's story so well. I think that the deterioration he suffered is in some ways typical of how achalasia can develop; and it does show how getting to the right experts to do the right procedure can change things dramatically. OMG, I had no idea someone that young would be going through all that. Thank you for telling your son's story. I had the exact same surgery, but mine was caused by a lap band being too tight and food building up in the esophagus for years. I wonder if your son took part in eating contests or ate so much food in binge eating that it started storing in his esophagus? Did he have constant coughing? I did and still do, 1 month after surgery at Mayo Clinic. I was told I had no more peristalsis and food and liquid would have to go down by gravity. ALso, the muscle or sphincter holding contents back in the stomach after eating was dead, so that is why they formed a new muscle in the Dor Fundoplication. I don't have food coming up anymore, and my voice is not too hoarse anymore. But my surgeon told me I still may have GERD as it doesn't always fix that. At least things are better. But you should know that this CAN kill you. The longer stomach acids come up and ravage the esophagus, it can develop into Barrett's Esophagus, which is pre-Cancer. Once all is \"fixed\" by surgery, only time will tell whether the damage done will heal on it's own. My best wishes to you and your son, for a happy and healthy life!"

          "Hello to all. First let me say to all that I know exactly what you're going through. I don't have this disorder, my son does. I'll try to be as thorough as possible so all questions you might have will be answered. My Son s 19 years old. And after numerous tests and doctors appointments he was finally diagnosed with achalasia. This all started about 10 months ago. My son Had graduated form High School and entered the University. He has always been active in school sports (baseball) is his game. His weight as a freshmen in High School was arund 205 lbs. he was 6'2 at the time. His weight fluctiuated from 215 lbs to 240 lbs in his last three years of high school. By the time he graduated from HS he was 6'4 220. In the first year of University life he got up to 244lbs. No activity, just eating and eating...hahahaha... Around 10 months ago we started noticing something that was new in him. When he would eat, he would make this strange sound. He said it was hic-ups, but he did it with an exagereated sound. But everything was nomal. He could eat like before no problems at all with anything. Only thing was that weird sound he'd make. (hic-ups) This went off and on for a while. About five months ago he started saying he felt preasure in his chest when he ate. He felt like he had too much acid in his stomach and felt the food come up. Obviously we thought heartburn and told him to take anti-acids. That never worked. Finally in April 7th we had a doctors appointment to see what this was. Up to now he felt the preasure, but he still felt good. He was active, went out and play football, baseball etc. he went as far as telling the doctor that if not for this weird strange feeling in his chest and throat he felt like he could run a marathon. He was given mediscations for aci reflux, those didn't work. We knew then it was not acid reflux. From there we were sent to a ENT specialist. Ear Nose and Throat Doctor. He didn't find anything wrong that he could see. That specialist ordered a swallow study. When he went for that study it came back normal. My Son told us that day he felt fine.....he felt like the thing he swallowed pass through nornmally, something that was not the case every other time. He discribed it as bubbles in his throat with preasure on his chest. From there we went to a GNT. He had a endescopy done in early June. That revealed nothing. Everything was normal. A byopsy was done on his esophagus during that endescopy and it too came back normal. During this time form April to June we see him having a lot more difficulty eating. On the visit to the doctor on April he weighed 244 lbs. When we saw the Gastorenterplogyst he was down to 230 lbs. The G doctor was miffed by these syptoms and went as far to tell us there was nothing else he could do. He said he had never seen a case like this. By this time my wife and myself were on the internet looking for answers and we found a test called upper GI test. The famous Barium swallow test. We suggested to his G doctor to order this test. He did and we saw the problem. When they saw the issue they couldn't believe he was getting anything down. The liquid he got was just stuck at the bottom of his esophagus. From there he got another study done. This one was a Manometry study, were they measure the preassure on the esaphagus. His results were not good. He had stage 2 achalasia. From the first day he visited our primary doctor on April 7th to July 30th my son weighed 212 lbs. Once we had all the information he decided to go into surgery. Dr. Mark Takata from Scripps Health in San Diego, California did the procedure. By now we knew all the options for him, but the decision was my sons. In the last three weeks befor surgery he couldn't even drink water. He would have to vomit to feel relief. He had his good days and bad days. in the last three weeks before surgery it seemed like he had nothing but bad days. Every time he vomited it was self induced. He had to make himself vomit to get relief. Not eeven water would go to his stomach , it was that bad. By the grace of God something did pass down to his stomach because he was still having bowel movements. Not as fgrequent as before obviously, but he still had to go to the bathroom. He joked every time he would go to the batroom he'd would ckeck off a sign at the door he was planning on placing....Puke, Piss, Poop......hahahahaha....that's because everytime he got up when we were eating we asked......are you going to puke ??? And we were all tired and stressed about this. July 30th,2014 was the day he had a Myatomy done. The procedure took about 2 hours. He had a Heller Myotimy with a Dor Fundoplacation. You all know what this is im sure. Today is the 7th day after surgery. He is doing very well. When he came out of surgery his face was puffy due to the air used to inflate the stomach. within 7 hour of the surgery that swelling started to go down. By the next day he still had puffyness under his eyes, but by the day we went home that swelling was gone. His procedure was done on Wednesday July 30th and we were dismissed from the hospital on Friday August 1st. The pain he has was normal pain associated with the procedure. He had five incissions in his abdomen. and those are the ones that hurt. He started eating liquids and THEY ALL WENT DOWN right after surgery. He said he felt the water go down to his stomach for the first time in many months. He didn't feel that water, food stuck feeling in his chest anymore. On Friday morning 2 days after surgery he had a very severe pain in his chest. This was due to gas. He couldn't pass gas. This was atributated to the narcodics he was given for pain. He did pass gas a few times on Thursday, but very minimal. That particular pain happened three times After surgery.Friday morning, Friday night at home and Saturday evening . He had the same barium swallow study done on Friday at the hospital to see if the surgety was working fine. It was. The sawllow he had went right through. He's been eating very soft foods. noodles, sopus, pastas (very moist) ice cream, chicken (also very moist chicken ) not fried, but little pieces of chicken in the noodles. Also rice he;s had. He has gone to the bathroom normally with no problems. Not that he had digestive pronblems before, but bathroom trips are as normal as you might want after surgery. We know all the risks and what might follow after this surgery, but it was really the only option he had due to his symptoms.. As soon as he came out of surgery he could drink and it would go right through without any problems. Dr. Takata who performed the operarion told us he normally shaves off 7 cm of the muscle fibers in the esophagus, but this time he did 9 cm. not quite sure what the reason for this was, but he did explain to us why. I just don't remember. If any of you has any questions that I might be able to help with plrase feel free to ask me. This disorder is a bad one. it's incredibly stressing for everyone involved. As a Father it eats at you to see your kids go through this and not be able to protect them and help them. The one thing I can tell everyone is that while this disorder is very bad, it's not going to kill you. The're options to fight this thing just have to keep faith and not give up. I will keep posting here to update my sons condition. I pray and hope he continues on this path and regains some sort of normalcy. OnlyGod knows what awaits us. Our job is to do everything possible to get better. Good luck to all, and remember you're not alone. Your family is with you and that makes a huge difference. God Bless."

          " Hi i was diagnosed about 15 to 20 years ago. I have been having cervical epidural injections for about 5 years which do help for a while as i only have 5% movement in my neck. I also get bad pain in my legs and the base of my spine and sometimes choke when eating but i dont get any response when i tell doctors, any suggestions. I was also told it does not run in families have you been told different. I would also like to know if you have had any advice about cutting down the calcium build-up. I have recently been told that i have a slipped disc which is not helping with the pain. How do you detect bony growths as i have been told anything about this but i have noticed changes to the shape of me in certain areas. many thanks roy Hi, I have been struggling to be diagnosed with this horrible disease .Finally after years of being told it just bone spurs and once they fuse it will be pain free. Well its still continuing and I have just had two Mri scans and the doctors and radiologist were amazed at the extent of damage to my spine. My throat troubles me the most, eating is becoming a chore and I am on mostly muchy food. The muscle spasms are worst ot night time. I feel lucky to be able to chat to someone else who knows what im talking about . Do you know the outcome for us is it wheelchair or paralisis????? Thanks for sharing Melissa Hi i was diagnosed about 20 years ago when i was in my thirties i am now 56. Was the drug Suboxone any good and what are you on now. I am on amytriptaline, tramadol, and arthrotec but all they do is take the edge off. Regards Roy I have been diagnosed with Dish today,have been told had flat feet then just getting old,then Fibromyalgia then poss Parkinsons disease,now have answer after years of pain and suffering,feel I am finished as can only get worse but must carry on somehow,not sure if would be able to get benefits if have to pack up work. Regards Steve I AM A 72 YEAR OLD FEMALE WHO HAS JUST BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DISH. I AM DEPRESSED THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE WITH THIS DISEASE. ALREADY I TAKE TRAMADOL AND ALEVE BUT I ALWAYS HAVE PAIN IN MY BACK AND NECK AND A LOT OF STIFFNESS.IS THERE ANY ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT FOR THIS DISEASE, SOMETHING BESIDES BEING TREATED BY STRONG DRUGS THAT HAVE BAD SIDE EFFECTS? THERE IS NO SUPPORT FOR THIS DISEASE, MY PRMARY CARE DR. TOLD ME THAT HE HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT.  When I was diagnosed at 42 5 years ago now it has done nothing but progress . My doctor told me that there was no cure and it is hereditary . I know stretching helps , as much exercise as your capable . Keeping your weight as close to normal as you can . Regular massages and chiropractic adjustments if you prefer or both if you can afford it . Narcotics did not help me so I just take glucosamine ( although I read it's not very effective on this particular arthritis ) but I've been taking it anyway and I think it's helping , some kind of inflammatory whether it be over counter or prescription . A friend of mine swears that B12 helps in mega doses . I do all these things and have a hot tub in my back yard , all of which help but I still experience substantial pain . Good luck I'm a male and I just turned 71. I have had this disease for many years, but was only diagnosed with it in 2004. My son has it and both my dad and his dad had it. They have tried everything from massage to pills on me, with only minimal relief. I have gad to force myself to get up and go and keep busy. They told me back years ago I'd be in a Wheelchair by now, but I refuse. Once I was 6' 6\" tall, but with the disease causing my head to bend over Forward, I'm only at a little over 6'. The muscle spasms at night are the worse. They keep me up most nights. I have to sit on the side of the bed and rock back and forth. But, there has been some good news for me!! There has been a great deal of controversy lately about the health effects of cannabis. They have been using the non-psychoactive part, CBD, to treat a great number of diseases. Some of them include diseases that cause muscle spasms, which caught my eye. I had the opportunity to try some of this oil and I'm sold on the fact that it worked for me. I got a good nights sleep. Something that I don't experience very often. Until the laws change though, I'm not able to get it. Too bad as it worked well. I have been recently diagnosed with forestiers disease. So far it only affects my thoracic spine and involves simply upper back pain, so I am lucky so far. The literature so far provides no direct clue to the disease but it apparently is related to calcification of muscle, tendon and ligaments. It is connected to other disease pathologies which also appear to linked to the mineral calcium and possibly an imbalance/shortage with magnesium. Diabetes Mellitis High Blood Pressure Arteriosclerosis Elevated heart rate Has there been any studies regarding this avenue of pathology or treatment?  Dan, I have been taking magnesium for over 6 years now. I don't know if it helps or not. They told me that since this is a rare/orphan disease, not much study is being done. They still don't know what causes it, nor is there a cure. I've had to push myself to keep going. If I slow down at all, I stiffen up and it takes a great deal of effort to get that mobility back. I have been taking 4.5mg of Naltrexone, a medication usually given in much larger doses to treat drug overdose in the ER. My Doctor started treating her MS patients with it for the spasms with success so started me on it. I've been on it for about 4 years and it has helped some. I don't know if any of this has helped you or answered any of your questions. I'm here if you want to respond.  Hi. I have DISH and according to my X-rays I have bone growth between the vertebra of my spine from my neck to my pelvis. I also have heel spurs in my left foot and severe Achilles tendonitis in the back of the heel. More importantly, I have a bone growth on my sitbone! The pain specialist I saw yesterday didn't even know what to think! He has never seen anything like that in the 35 years he has been a doctor. The extra bone growth on my sitbone makes it feel like I am sitting on a ball. It is painful and uncomfortable and makes driving for long periods difficult. Has anyone else experienced pain in the sitbone area?"

          "I have finally found info on Forestier's disease!! When I was first diagnosed back in 1988 my doctor had no material on this subject. I was told to go home and find it on my computer, which I did. There was a researcher in Canada who hit the nail right on the head, Forestier's is no pick nick! He was so right! When I was first diagnosed with the disease, I was in a lot of back pain. I had x-rays done and this article is correct....my vertebral area looked as if I were leaking wax. I saw all sorts of bony hooks hanging from each and every vertebrate and I was in a lot of pain; but my doctor at that time said I couldn't be in pain, as it wasn't painful??? On the contrary, the article I was told to research stated that there is a great deal of pain associated with the disease and eventually it would be crippling and that is where I am, 20 years later. At the first time I was diagnosed, I didn't know that my choking could be associated with the disease itself, I thought it was just asthma...after all \\&quot;it isn't that bad.\\&quot; I was placed on many anti-inflammatory medications. I was place on one that I suddenly would loose my speech and get confused...I was told they might be TIA's. Later this particular drug was found to do just that. Since it wasn't helping, I was put on another anti-inflammatory and the doctor doubled the recommended dose and later I found that the sphincter muscle to my stomach and been burned away from too much of a good thing. I was told not to see a chiropractor and for good reason! I had a complication from a surgery and they had to knock me out in order to go down my throat....while under someone turned my head further than I could myself and broke a facet in my neck; now I have plates in my neck and need more surgery....Once my neck was repaired, I didn't choke any longer. Right now, the disease has gotten so bad that I have many areas of stenosis and nerve root cut off. The neurosurgeon who performed my first neck surgery stated that every opening that allows the nerve roots to channel through my body was loaded with razor sharp spurs. This is just the spinal region of my body. I am beginning to calcify at every ligament insertion site. I have bony over growth in my feet, which interfere with the articulation of my foot joints. I can feel the bones sticking out of my ankles and the tops of my feet; I'm beginning to fuse in my left foot. In three weeks I'm heading for a double knee replacement because my left knee can't support my knee cap; over growth of bone has pushed it away. It is getting more and more difficult to participate in daily activities as my range of motion is becoming limited. My elbows and my shoulders are affected as well...I can feel bony growth there as well. I'm losing feeling in my legs, as my nerves are being pinched; the pain shoots down to my feet and it is gripping. My hands can't grip a phone for any length of time. I found if my pain can be controlled, I can function well, but too many doctors are not up on the pain this disease produces. Controlling the pain keeps me moving, and that is what you need to do, but the support isn't there for this. The disease is so rare that it is brushed off as regular osteoarthritis and it isn't, it's no where near the same. I was diagnosed in my thirties and I have lived with chronic pain for over twenty years now. I was told that it affects mostly males over the age of 70....bunk! It is genetic, as my mother had it and wasn't properly diagnosed with the disease and my brother has it as well. My mother and I were deeply affected, she had it her feet as well and by the time she reached 70, she couldn't walk without crying in despair. I had one doctor treat me with Suboxone and it was the only drug that gave me back the quality of life others enjoyed. He left for the north and I am back in severe pain once again. The problem with this disease, it's a square peg and everyone wants to fit into a round hole. I try to keep a smile on my face for my families sake, but the pain can be read all over my face. I'm still young, by today's standards and I just want to be a participant in this life, not stuck in some corner watching my life and the world go passed me."
