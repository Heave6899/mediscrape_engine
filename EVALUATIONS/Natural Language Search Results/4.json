          " I seriously doubt the doxycycline has anything to do with what you are experiencing. It is a very safe drug with a proven track record of safety over multiple decades. If you are going to experience side effects with doxycycline - and many people do but this is dose dependent - then it will be while you are on the medicine not when you come off it.  i took two doxy yesterday for a sinus infection, oh my word i had the worst palpatations, im due to take another one now and im scared, i have to take them becuse they are a very good antibiotic and i want to clear this up but im o scared. ive never had an anti do this to me before  I have been suffering from chronic bronchitis, pneumonia or infective asthma recently, this info from my gp. I have been coughing, wheezing, and have chest pains. I was on clarithromycin for 5 days now gp said not working! On steroids also. Today he changed me to doxycycline and 3 hours after my 1st dose had severe stomach cramps and nausea followed by a long sit on the loo, if you get my drift! Now 1.15am still in pain with nausea with a hot water bottle on stomach. I do not intend taking another tomorrow and will see gp on thurs. I feel as I have glutened but for longer. I know nothing else would have caused it has to be the antibiotics. Allergic to penicillin now this! I feel for you perhaps it stayed in your system it does take several days for it to exit depending on how long you have been on it. Perhaps this antibiotic is not as safe as people think?  <p>I am not sure the two are related but I can tell you this. I had my gallbladder removed in 1989.&#160; I never did get past the point of feeling sick all the time.&#160; Last year I saw a specialist. He asked me, didn&#39;t the doctor that removed your gallbladder tell you that you should be taking medicine the rest of your life?&#160; I asked why. He said because your body can&#39;t&#160; dispose of the bile from your liver.&#160; I don&#39;t know if that is true or not. He told me to take Bioplasma cell salts, so I have been taking them since.&#160; Have they helped? I don&#39;t know because I have other issues that make me sick all the time..... Sure wish I could find a doctor that really cared about a patients wellness : ((&#160; My dermatologist put me on Doxycycline to deal with Rosacea in my eyes. Is it helping? I don&#39;t think so because they still itch. ???? I just printed off the side effects from Doxycycline and thought about stopping the drug. The side effects I am having are horrible.&#160; I have an appt with her this Friday, but until then, I am done with the drug.</p> I had a similar, violent reaction to Doxy. I followed directions - to take the drug on a full stomach. Nonetheless, soon after taking the first dose, my stomach started to churn and gurgle. I had a large dinner that night and took a second capsule. I was fine. The third capsule, the following morning after a large bowl of oat bran (no dairy) set the wheels in motion. I had attacks of gas and an aching stomach. After lunch, it was all over for me, with explosive diarrhea, cramping and nausea. I haven't puked yet, but the idea does have appeal at times. Last week I had a stomach bug that knocked me out for a day and a half. The Doxy experience is reminiscent of the stomach infection. Perhaps I wasn't entirely cured and the drug kicked me off again. I also have had a problem with malaria preventatives (not Doxy) with stomach problems and nightmarish dreams. I am thinking Doxy isn't for me and hope that my doc can come up with another course of action. I have asked to be tested for penicillin sensitivity and hope that's going to work out OK. i have had to take doxycycline for 3 weeks due to a dental abscess. when i started taking it i would notice nausea here and there a couple of days at a time. ... however i was sure it was from the ativan i take when i go to the dentist because it usually only lasts 2 days right after i take it. this time it never went away. i woke up with the most painful burning in my stomach up to my throat in the middle of the night. then i started feeling a lump in my throat and regurgitation. the nausea got so bad i could not move without throwing up. if i stood, walked, sat, laid, talked shut up i threw up. i just stopped 4 days ago and i literally still feel like throwing up. i went to my doctor because i was afraid i had sepsis or cancer or something because too be sure this medicine and gerd cant make you that nauseous right????.... wrong.!! my doctor who is a cancer survivor even told me that if she takes doxycycline she throws up. its a known side effect and some people get it worse than others. i was on it for a long time and taking it on an empty stomach because i was already nauseous. that made it worse. i had horrible headaches and my head felt like it would burst at any moment. i say all of that to say this..... i am day 4 no doxycycline and i am taking zofran from the nausea it has caused me. my dr told me between taking it and 4 ibuprofen 4 to 5 times a day for the last 6 days due to the insane headache i got from it i was destroying the lining of my stomach. i am now still taking the zofran and although i still feel nauseous its the first day i was able to eat or drink anything in the past 6 days. i have to take dexilant for the severe ulcers it gave and carafate to coat the lining of my stomach so it can heal. i still questioned if just that alone could make you that horribly nauseous and she said yes. it caused gerd and gerd can do it. its also a known side effect. you took too much ibuprofen the headache . all of those combined is enough to destroy your insides. needless to say i hope you feel better and it is def. reassuring that others are experiencing the same issues. DOXYCYCLINE IS THE WORSE MED I HAVE EVER TAKEN AND WILL NEVER AGAIN TAKE.  I think you suffer from anxiety, its either that, or you are taking a dosage too high. The higher the dose the more likely of side effects."

          " Hiya I'm really sorry you're struggling with this. I suffer from Endometriosis which can give you the symptoms of IBS as well as everything else! On the endo forum I go on some of the ladies who suffer from the same problem as you get something called Lactulose from their GP which is a stool softener, you take it in a drink and can have up to 6 sachets a day to help move things along. They also recommend to drink things like Pineapple Juice as that has an enzyme in it which can help your digestion and solve constipation. Also Aloe Vera juice is very good too. Practically try and drink lots of plain water or herbal tea too. Hope that helps and you feel better soon... Kitty Worry can definitely create a vicious cycle of IBS troubles. Just an aside.... I've spent the Bank holiday cutting out tea, chocolate and eating smaller meals. I've been drinking only water and although I don't feel totally wonderful I do feel a big improvement in my IBS condition. This has lifted my spirits somewhat which helps with my overall feeling of wellbeing. My pursuit of ways of reducing the severity of my symptoms is a work in progress so I'll post other findings on this site. I do hope your symptoms ease soon :) :roll: Ginger tea, camomile tea...peppermint tea...all work ok for me. Can't do coffee anymore, or any fizzy drinks (get heartburn) and curry is definitely out, although I love it. Had a bad bout 2 weeks ago, very bad diarrhoea, so stupidly took Imodium as I had to go to work. Didn't go at all for 4 days after, so had to take Lactulose (brilliant stuff, works really well without giving you griping pains) which took another 2 days to work. Bloated??? :oops: Wind??? :oops: That has taught me never to take Imodium again, although it really worked well! Personally, I find Buscopan the best for the pains, and I've tried lots of others over the years (Colpermin, Mebeverine, etc.) :wink: Keep smiling, it helps with the stress, although you do sometimes look a bit goofy! Sorry to hear about your bad month. I swing between constipation and diarrhoea. I would keep taking the Mebeverine. My GP said I could take it all the time, not just when I'm having an attack, and others on this forum have also mentioned they take between just 1 a day to 3 a day all the time. I've found it keeps things moving along nicely and my stomach is nice and flat now. hi i to am having bad week . constipation 3 days, took psylium husk diarhoa for 2 days , horrendous pain , i have suffered 10 years since diagnosed , before that endometriosis , had total hysterectomy which was brill , but found out through colonoscopys that it was ibs , perscibed colofac, dont help i am not nervous person so dont think that starts mine, i find if i eat healthy ,ie veg fruit bran , i go down with bad bout,i have no cure for you but if i find one i will be sure to share it. remember you are not alone although it feels like it at the time. take care following a hysteroctomy in may 2007 i have suffered constipation terribly usually only going once every 10 days or so i've used lactulose ,senna,movicol and eventually enemas from hospital. I stopped taking these as they didn't seem to make too much difference now the past 2 weeks i seem to have went in the complete opposite direction and cant go too far from the toilet. Doctors have not diagnosed me yet but i was wondering if this would be typical of ibs cos its driving me nuts and feels like inside of my stomach is bruised any body help !!! Hiya all, I thank my doctor for giving the web addy for this forum, it has been very helpful, the last five weeks have been hell. I was on buscapan but during this last boubt it was useless. I cut out all dairy and slowly increased my fibre intake, again it didn't really work very well. I had serve diahoerra. th pain was almost unbareable. My doctor put me on mebeverine about a few days ago and now after taking that I'm almost back to normal. Different things work for different people, it helped knowing that it really was just my IBS playing up and knowing that there was a way to combat it. I hope your boubt is over soon."

          " I had the same was given the tablets by A&amp;E, I started bringing up blood soon after! 2 weeks on after stopping the tablet im still unable to cope with food! I researched this drug and the results were scarey! This drug should be removed ! Gastrointestinal upsets are among the most commonly reported side effects to diclofenac. I would say that in my experience severe reactions to diclofenac (if prescribed correctly) are rare. There is a type of medication available on prescription from your GP that can lessen the gastric side effects - see under omeprazole. Always take diclofenac with food - on an empty stomach is never a good idea. hi julia, i personally think each person is different, i take diclofenac and i've been fine, i take it for OA, prolapsed disc, and DDD, i doesn't get rid of the pain completely but i know it helps :magic: , but i've been told that i shouldn't be on it for too long, by a :doctor:, but i'll ask my gp next time i see him, cos i was on meloxicam and they upset my tummy, and i really don't want to try anymore, maybe it depends on what other medication you on :!: talk to your gp maybe he can change them cos thats the last thing you want eh.... take care, hope you get things sorted, and that you feel better soon :cheerup: mandy Hi there Declofenec or decl!!oflex is a god send like someone said if you take with food you should be fine!!!! My doctor gives me lansoprazole , gastro-resistant capsules and I have been on declofenec for over 6 months and I am ok!!!! take care all Regards SES Hi been on diclofenac for over a year now for spondilitis. dont know how id manage without it. always take after food and with plenty of water. Doc gave me gostro tabs to start with but took away after 2 months as ody then used to them. so far ok!!!! :D started on max of 150g now managing on 50 or 75g a day. hi there all I went to a pain clinic and the doctor there said as he had a broken coaxic he didn't need medication and I don't need it neither, he said there was nothing particular wrong with me but yet put me on Gabapentine (for neuropathic nerve pain)and he said to take the declofenic as and when needed, but as it is you need to take it on a regular basis as I have found the effects are not the same.........Declofenic has to be taken regularly and it works well with Tramadol. regards SES Hi I'm on diclofenac 100 but I can hardly stay awake on them. They slow my reactions down even though I don't drive. I forget things and can fall asleep at the drop of a hat. They mildly help with the pain, but not enough for me to forget it!. They also give me constipation, acne on my back and high blood pressure and I'd love to try a different strong pain killer without these side effects. Can anyone recommend a different pain killer that may help I've tried all the ones in Boots. Hi replying to Guest..... Replace Diclofenac with Tramadol. I started on Diclofenac and am now on Tramadol and this is how it has clouded my thinking! Hi there All I had been on Diclofenac and in total I have been on anti - inflammatories for over a year, now I find that my liver function test is four times the amount it should be? Surely this isn't healthy and after seeing the consultant on Thursday he said that they can help you be over weight. So what do you do? I am wondering if there is a tablet or something you can take to stop you from being over weight due to anti-inflammatory consumption? something too somehow counter act the effects????? As it is my prescription is to be changed to another one, Celecoxib and as I have an underactive thyroid it is difficult to loose weight anyway, what can we do for long time use of anti- inflammatories? Kind Regards SES :oops: Side effects for all drugs are different in each person who takes it. i have not really seen alot of difference with Diclofenac, but i know others who have been quite ill. The suck it and see method it all the doctors have to go on, you try it if it doesn't agree with you stop taking it and go back and get something else and try again. i have been going through this cycle for many years and have given up several times, but there is always new stuff and new research Claire My wife was prescribed these for almost the same problem - painful [shoulder] joint syndrome. They worked fine except that a blood test revealed the potassium level in her kidneys had shot up to a potentially dangerous level. She had to stop the diclofenac and is now suffering a recurrence of the shoulder pain and looking for an alternative NSAID. [quote:92631d0bef=\\\"Julia\\\"]:I have been prescribed Diclofenac 50mg 3 times a day for pain and restricted movement due to frozen shoulder. After 3 days of taking the tablets I started getting stomach pains and diarrhoea, so stopped taking them. On the 4th day the stomach ache lasted all day - not severe but annoying enough to be a nuisance. I am today going to try reducing the dose to 2x50mg a day and see if that lessens the side effects. On the plus side the movement in my shoulder did seem a little better after just 3 days on the tablets. The dr has put me on them for 3 weeks only and will reassess after that. Anyone else had these side effects?[/quote:92631d0bef] I was prescribed Diclofenac and Fenactol on seperate occasions for persistant back pain. I rarely take them every day but lately i have been doing. Today, however, I have been experiencing severe stomach pains, diarrhoea and a strange pain across my lower back (internally, hard to explain really) I really feel something has started to affect me. I think i will get myself back to the Doc and try and sort another method to sort my pain out and steer clear of these pills. I was prescribed Diclofenac in the February of 2009 after about two weeks of industrial strength heartburn and heart flutters, I decided to stop the medication. Two weeks later I suffered a stroke from which happily I have fully recovered but remain on six items of medication per day, perhaps for life. Anyone like me? James 63yrs  I have been using a topical diclofenac cream (1%) & have been experiencing severe diarrhoea, nausea & lack of appetite. I remember having to discontinue using the pills when they were prescribed to me 3 years ago for the same reason. No amount of food or medication like Omeprozole could make me tolerate this drug. I have Hep.C, although it does not affect me in any way, but I guess it does mean my liver is in some way compromised. When I only used the cream for neck pain it did not have this effect, but a week ago I started using it on my knees as well, which was when I started to experience these side effects. Is it possible that a topical cream could have these side effects?"

          " You wouldn\u2019t get Haematochezia with IBS. Is the blood mixed in with the stool or separate? Once a flare begin do you continue to notice blood in your stools? Anaemia - Do you have heavy periods? - Are your stools very pale (cream color)? IBS can cause horrendous abdominal cramps as bad as those experienced with IBD. Have you had stool tests - Stool Culture and Foecal Calprotectin? Do you know whether your inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR) are raised? The only further test you could have is a small bowel MRI (to look at the part of the gut which OGD and Colonoscopy can\u2019t get to).  <p>Hi thankyou for replying, a couple of days before a flare up I notice bloody mucus when I wipe also dark stools that&#39;s look a bit bloody. During a flare it tends to die down. When I had the blood test for anemia I hadn&#39;t had a period in weeks and I don&#39;t get heavy periods. My stools sometimes are pale in colour but that is quite rare but I look very pale and unwell most of the time. I haven&#39;t had a stool test to test for those things on for H Pylori. I am due to have a MRI scan of the small intestine soon but I was wondering would it show up if I wasn&#39;t in a flare? I feel like my symptoms don&#39;t match ibs, especially as I&#39;m 17 and it leaves me bedbound for weeks.&#160;</p> <p>Hi Charlotte</p><p></p><p>I&#39;m so sorry you are suffering like this and have yet to get any answers as to the cause. I, like many others here, totally understand how it feels when you have symptoms and pain and no clear diagnosis but they will get there for you hang on in there. I just hope you have a good consultant and understanding gp as this is very important with any longterm health issue although at least your consultant was honest when he said he is treating you for IBS at the moment. Your story sounds similar to mine in parts although many bowel conditions do have overlapping symptoms. It can be tricky to work out what is triggering the flareups try keeping a diary of when they happen and what you were eating in the days before.</p><p>Are you on any medication that could be making your symptoms worse? I have had bowel problems for many yrs starting as a young girl like yourself...mine was partially linked to a gynaecological condition called endometriosis which can cause ibs type symptoms and severe pain. I also had some rectal bleeding which often happened before or during a period and was getting worse diarrhoea during my period but that can be caused by hormone changes and/ or taking pain relief with anti inflammatories in them. Please stay away from painkillers in the nsaid group as anything with ibuprofen naproxen voltarol etc in them can make bowel problems worse. In my late 20&#39;s and early 30&#39;s I took lots of ibuprofen as my endometriosis was severe and I couldn&#39;t get to work or stay there without them wish I hadn&#39;t now. </p><p>In 2008 I was admitted to hospital with severe diarrhoea and vomiting and was dehydrated. I had intavenous fluids and when they did another colonoscopy there was a question mark over the biopsies as they thought I had/have a type of microscopic colitis...my consultant has said it is possible but I&#39;ve since been found to have crohn&#39;s in the terminal ileum which was only investigated again when my blood tests showed iron deficiency anaemia and low b12 levels.</p><p>I have altered my diet and am mostly dairyfree and wheatfree wherever possible although I do eat some wheat. I take a good probiotic called quest mega 8 biotix which definitely helps me a lot. I take it twice a day with food.</p><p>I also take Mebeverine 3 day and buscopan 8 a day. I have steroids called budesonide which I had a trial of initially then had them for a year and now take them during a flareup. I have also had polyps removed.</p><p>I would ask if its possible to have microscopic colitis ruled out or tested for when you next have a colonoscopy. If it is crohn&#39;s there is a lot more support and info around now it seems.</p><p>I hope you get some answers soon but don&#39;t lose heart you will find out what helps you.</p><p>Hope I&#39;ve helped a bit...</p><p>Take care</p> <p>Hi Charlotte,</p><p></p><p>Sorry to hear your going through this. &#160;I&#39;ve recently seen my consultant who believes I don&#39;t have crohns but I had an infection. &#160;He said he didn&#39;t want to miss anything if it was crohns so he&#39;s decided to give me a calprotecin test every 6 months for a yr or so as a colonoscopy won&#39;t show anything unless I have active inflammation. &#160;An MRI could also be normal if in remission. &#160;I would have a calprotecin wen you have symptoms and if its high then they should investigate further. &#160;In regards to the blood having rectum bleeding could be piles or a teae unless the blood is mixed in the the stools</p> Hi Charlotte I totally understand your pain. I\u2019m 17 and I have been suffering from bowel problems for a year and when it first began I was told I had IBS but then after a few stool samples I was told that I had camphlorbacter and h.pylori so I was put on antibiotics to cure that. After I was treated for the bacteria and it cleared my symptoms came back. I have abdominal pain, gas, bloating, diarrhoea, the feeling of not completely emptying my bowels, very loud abdominal noises, hunger pains and growls, indigestion, mucus and sometimes blood in my stool. I was given buscopan, peppermint oil, medbeverine and I bought loads of over the counter medications, non of which worked. When I eat I have to empty my bowels straight away or around 30mins after. I currently take Imodium which makes my stools a bit more firm but still very loose and codine since it the only thing that works for the pain. The doctors don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me and I\u2019ve had various blood tests done and they didn\u2019t show anything except that I was anaemic,I\u2019m due to have and endoscope and colonscope in a few weeks and hopefully that will show what\u2019s wrong with me. I have no clue what\u2019s wrong with me and why I have these symptoms. I\u2019m so sorry you have to go through that too. "

          " Hey Jordan. I have similar issues to you, im a 24 year old female and I was diagnosed as having clostridium difficile in sept then relapsed again in Jan 16. The Dr's are saying I have post infectious ibs but I'm the same as you, I think to myself that surely ibs isn't this bad, I can barely do anything with my symptoms. I'm undergoing investigations with gastro to find out if there is anything else to discover. I'll tell you what medications I get however I of course don't know the criteria for a prescription so just ask your Dr. I have a neurological disorder and long story short I have nerve damage, due to the pain I was sick a lot and my Dr prescribed me with cyclazine (don't know how to spell it). However my neuro problems are better now so I don't actually need the medication for this. Since I have cdiff though, I had up to 15 bouts of diarrhoea a day, sickness, tummy pains, cold sweats (especially at night) and sometimes I'd experience elevated heart rate and hot flushes. It completely took over my life, they said that the bacteria in my gut wasnt balanced due to the infection so my digestive system was working extra hard and caused ibs symptoms. I then started taking the cyclazine for these symptoms, I don't need it daily, but when I feel sick to the point of throwing up I take one and within 10-15 minutes I feel better. I found that eating in the morning before I took any of my tablets tends to keep nausea at bay, so maybe some of your tablets make you feel sick on an empty stomach? I'd try it out and see how you get on, have toast or something then half an hour later take your medication. You didn't mention if you had diarrhoea, but due to the frequency of your toilet visits it would suggest you have? I tried everything to stop it, nothing worked for me (although some people have had success with probiotics etc) finally my Dr prescribed me with codeine phosphate, you can take up to 3 a day but I only take two to avoid being over constipated. It changed my life, it pretty much stopped the diarrhoea. Plus with it being a pain killer too it helped with the stomach pains. I do yoga every other day, I started this during all this bother and it's hard to stay focused when your attention is on your stomach pains and toilet trips, but eventually you learn how to switch off and take your mind off it. (This does take a while so you need to stick to it and persevere). I go for a hot bath every night and I use lavender bubble bath, if you are like me, my stomach kept me up at night and I'd have various trips to the toilet, the warmth helps with any stomach pains and the lavender helps you feel rested for bed. (I will point out that I never actually got into a proper sleeping routine until I was put on codeine phosphate, as this relieved me of the more aggresive symptoms to then let my body actually settle at night). Naturally your anxiety levels are going to be through the roof, trust me, I know it all too well! But speak to your Dr about these options as they honestly really did help me. Especially codeine phosphate, I don't know what I would have done without it. Now I can actually think about returning to uni since I had to drop out, purely bc of being in hospital too often, but if it wasn't for this, I'd probably have not managed to go back. Let me know how you get on will you? I'd like to hope our next convo has some good news.  IBS can be very debilitating depending on the severity of your symptoms and can cause anxiety and depression. Has your doctor diagnosed you with IBS? It can be triggered after infections such as food poisoning. I got IBS after a succession of stressful episodes and developed chronic stomach pain with constipation, loose stools and on off nausea."

          " Hi, i have been having ongoing stomach issues for some time and after various tests I was told that they could not find a IBD but it was a functional bowel disorder. Then 7 weeks ago I was admitted into hospital with terrible stomach pains and was diagnosed as having infectious colitis which was brought on by the campylobacter virus and had to stay in for 5 days. Like you, I had had chicken the previous day but alongwith 4 family members who all appeared to be fine whereas I was hospitalised. I have had food poisoning a few times so I can only allude to the fact that my stomach is so sensitive that I seem to pick up everything. I am very wary with chicken and whereever possible, avoid it as its the most common form of food poisoning. When I asked the hospital if there was a direct link between the campylobacter and my stomach disorder, I could not get a straight answer. I personally believe that its too much of a coincedence for it not to be.  Thanks for sharing your experiences. I believe my wife may have just experieced the start of a similar thing. Involving earlier cryptosporidium bout and years later another related to chicken consumption. Thank you , as you have given me food for thought.  Hi Well i had campylobacter for 10 days i was in spain and was admitted 3 times where they couldnt find out what it was as i couldnt pass a stool i lost over a stone in weight and was bleeding very badly . Finaal came home and it was diagnosed. Ever since then i have upper right pain lower abdominal pain diahrear tummy sore to touch then it goes away for a few weeks then it flairs up where i can hardly move. I have been on a number of tests scans ultra sound mri with contrast with them finally saying its ibs .When it flares up its like food poisoning with lower cramps diahrear etc so i feel for you .Hope you get some releaf or diagnosis as its a knock on afect from having campylobacter a lot of people has different symptoms for years after it kev  Campylobacter infection - PLEASE CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR OR PHARMACIST ABOUT ANY MEDICINE AND PROBIOTICS MENTIONED BELOW, THEY MIGHT BE NOT SUITABLE FOR EVERYONE. I would like to share my experience with campylobacter infection (food poisoning, usually from raw meat or poultry) I had last month from one of the take away places. It started off with sudden stomach pains and diarrhoea (light or green colour). Doctors could not figure out what it was and took 3 visits to GP and finally getting some tests done (which took long time too cause they have lost them!), so from my first visit on 13th of June I got my antibiotics erythromycin for campylobacter infection on 21st of July! Meantime I had suffered real bad reaction to most foods, i.e. Diarrhoea each day several times, stomach pains about half an hour after food, felt very weak cause I knew I wasn't digesting food very well nor did the water stay in my body. Took about week and a half off work (week with a sick note). Usually it lasts 2-5 days but the period of my sickness was 7-8 weeks. During the whole time I was taking Lansoprazole in the mornings as it appeared I had gastritis superfitsialis chronica with it as well (had to do endoscopy for this).... Then no-spa ('mebeverine' in UK, after food to relax my muscles. I also made sure I took acidophilus probiotic - 1 a day, every day ( got from Holland and Barrett and I have to say, it did help me big time), I think It helped with restoring or not damaging too much of my insides during this infection. Eventually I found out that Saccharomyces Boulardii probiotic helps especially well during diarrhoea, I found a packet in Holland Barrett called Bioglan Serious Help One-A-Day Biotic Balance Ultimate Flora (20 billion live bacteria which has both probiotics together), so I've switched to this probiotic only at the moment. However, if you are immunocompromised - do not take S.Boulardii probiotic, it could be very dangerous or even fatal!!! On the first day of erythromycin I felt much better, diarrhoea stopped instantly, but it did come back every 2 days for about a week and a half. I had to be very strict with what I ate: oats in the morning with blueberrys, cinnamon and honey, then banana about 10 am, something steamed for lunch and supper. I ate 4 times a day before the antibiotics, as they damage the stomach lining too. I made sure there was 3 hour gap between antibiotic and probiotic for both of them to actually work ( I usually took probiotic before bed so it would work over night). I did not drink any coffee or tea, had only water or camomile or peppermint tea during the whole time. Campylobacter made me also lactose intolerant (which I found out after eating ice cream on a very hot summer day.... Not a pleasant surprise), so I had only lactose free milk and yogurts for about three weeks, but i am back to normal now. I also took some multivitamins as diarrhoea flushes a lot of nutrition from your body. I made sure I went for even little walks on fresh air in the evenings as erythromycin doesn't agree with the sun or artificial UV rays very much. I also tried to have a siesta every day when I was off sick at home - you recover better in the sleep. So this is how I fought campylobacter infection.... I hope this might help some of you to fight it. Also please look out for any muscle aches or respiratory problems - ring your doctor straight away if you get them - these could be dangerous rare side effects. And please try not to cook for others for about 3 weeks after healing and stay away from pregnant women and anyone with weak immune system, as it takes 2-3 weeks to completely get rid of campylobacter. Best of luck Hi rmjo, I am wondering if you are getting repeat infections of the adenovirus. This virus can definitely cause gastroenteritis and should not be ruled out. If you have little ones at home they are often susceptible to the virus and are perhaps spreading it to you. Talk to your doctor about that possibility. https://patient.info/health/adenovirus-gastroenteritis I thought I should reply to this as it's been over a year. Shortly after I wrote the above, I read an article about resetting your body's immune system through a 3-day fast, so thought I would give it a try. The fast itself was easier than I had thought, with nothing but water. I was amazed my will-power actually allowed me to do this, but I stuck to it. Since then, I have lived my life the same as always, continuing to eat chicken, and I haven't suffered from the described symptoms once. Maybe I've had a lucky year or maybe this has helped my body's tolerance levels, whichever it is, I am not going to complain and hope it continues. Thank you all for your replies, it has provided me with some useful reading. "

          " hi yes i was taking the same pills they made no diffrence to me at all i didnt get diarrhoea unless i ate the wrong food stuff, but i found i got the urgent need to go soon after food and my belly was making terrible sound lol , but i stopped taking the pills and i have to be careful what i eat it is trial and error with food sorry cant realy say anymore just my experience . Hi Debb13, I have been prescribed Mebeverine many times, I only use them when my IBS is particularly bad, and they do seem to help, without causing any side effects. I wouldn't worry about using them, I doubt if they will do any harm, even if you are taking them before the blood test results are back. Not everyone with IBS has diarrhoea, some people are constipated, whereas some vary between. Yes, the pain of IBS is horrible, I describe it as 'colicky' or 'gripe' pains, and you can also have a lot of bloating and flatulence. It can make you feel miserable. I hope you feel better soon. Often, just the knowledge that you have IBS, but that it is not serious, it will not develop into cancer, and that ultimately, despite being very unpleasant, it will do you no harm, is enough to reassure you, and it is easier to accept the symptoms in the knowledge that you will be fine. Over the years, this is what I have managed to do, and I have also identified the foods which trigger my IBS, such as too much wheat, so I try to avoid eating things which I know I will pay for later! Good luck, and try not to worry. :)  Thanks Wursty, that's helpful and good to know. I have had the blood results back over the telephone and they have come back normal so I have to go in now and see my Dr for another chat. I have taken the Mebeverine a few times but they seem to make me want to go to the loo in the early hours of the morning - not sure if this is just a coincidence!! It's the tiredness that I have really struggled with, particularly as I am a Mum of three. Anyway, stomach feeling quite a bit better this week - hopefully it will last a while. Hi Debb, Glad your results came back normal, that's great. I can empathise with how you are feeling, I too am a Mum of three boys, and my IBS began when they were all just little (they are now 26, 24 and 21!) and I was absolutely exhausted a lot of the time too. Glad your stomach is feeling better though, all the best with your chat with your doctor. I'm sure you will be fine. Take care. ;)  After all the tests i was told i had ibs., with urgency being the worst thing. I was scared to go anywhere that i could not acsess a toilet quickly.The pain was awful so i went back to my gp who prescibed mebeverine.They worked really quickly , but i only take them when needed .They do tend to make me constipated.(better than the other thing).Now i never go anywhere without a few in my pocket. A life saver for me.!!! Hi Debbie I have had ibs for 10 years now and a lot of different medication,I can recommend spasminal for your ibs much better than mebervine , it works instantly !doctors give one 10 mins before a meal but I recommend 2 For instant relief . Chin up xx  Thanks all for your comments. Wingwing - I will ask my doctor for spasminal as the mebeverine takes a while to work and as others have said seems to make me constipated. My main problem at the moment is chronic trapped wind which is sometimes excruciating. It's definitely linked to hormones for me as I am noticing a real pattern. I wish it would go away....... I try not to let it get me down and started running about three months ago. Sometimes its too painful and I can't go out for my run and other times I go anyway and it seems to help disperse some of the discomfort. On occasion I feel like my insides are going to drop out (that's a bit graphic, sorry!). xx I`ve been diagnosed with IBS years ago and 60 odd now!!! Have had Mebeverine Hydrochloride(Colofac) and found it alleviated severity of symptoms but not completely rid of them. GP probably gave them to you as they are pretty safe bet and they certainly don`t do any harm while you wait for your results. You dont need to have diarroah/constipation everyone different. Good luck and hope this has helped you I was recently diagnosed with IBS too and initially prescribed mebeverine which helped initially with the cramps i was getting but my symptoms worsened again and so i'm now trying peppermint oil capsules which again worked initially but my symptoms are worsening again :( I tend to find some days i can't eat anything without needing to go to the toilet urgently with severe abdominal cramps which makes me reluctant to go anywhere and is rather embarrassing does anyone else have this problem or know of anything that could help? xx In my experience the best medications by far for these terrible cramps and feelings are Merbentyl closely followed by Buscopan, a combination of the two is great as well. If it works for you Merbentyl is absolute bliss :)  Thank you i'll look into that :) are there any medications that can help with alternating diarrhoea and constipation or ease these symptoms at all?  RJ92 - I have been prescribed Fybogel Mebeverine which is supposed to help with both diarrhoea and constipation, however I have found it makes me quite constipated at times so I have stopped taking it as often as the box says to. It has really helped with my IBS though, it might be worth trying it. That's great i'll look into that, thank you :)  With randomly alternating diarrhea and constipation what you do is take both a laxative and an anti-diarrhoeal simultaneously :)  I was given these tablets but they made no difference they made me worse and made my stomach distend more since stopping them my stomach doesn't swell as bad but still swollen :("

          " Forgot to also mention that the nausea will usually subside when I've eaten something, I did say that in the title but yeah. Sometimes it comes back though for example if I go out somewhere (I travel on a train weekly) it can flare up suddenly and causes me anxiety because I'm afraid I will vomit in public. I am taking propranolol for my anxiety also but I think I will come off it soon because I don't think it is helping me at all, but that's beside the point. I know that it is not a side effect of that because I've been on it for over a month and surely the symptoms would have started sooner. Hi Jess hope your ok... I know exactly how you feel as I'm in the same boat.. I've been put on esomoprezole and anti sickness tablets which seem to work but you still get a quite not right feeling hanging over you...it's like a constant I'm going to get a sickness bug feeling and I'm the same have a fear of the vomiting bug. Today I've had really bad kidney pains I'm so fed up being sent for an abdominal scan just waiting for an appointment phone your doctor tomorrow to see if you can get an urgent appointment x Hi Jess, Have you looked into SIBO, bacterial imbalances or parasites? Have you done a comprehensive stool analysis or been tested for h.pylori? I hope you feel better soon! It's not fun living with IBS and waking up with nausea. Have you looked into the GAPS intro diet? It helped calm my nausea down. Hang in there and keep going as it is possible to improve. Hi Jess I used to get nausea after eating lunch I have acid reflux and hytius hernia I take opeprazol with peptic liquid if it wakes me at night with the acid burning my throat Antacid can usually make you constipated I found taking small amount of foods made the nausia better you can buy anti sickness pills over the counter if you want to see if that helps you until you can see a doctor hope you feel better Take care Kev  The first thing is to admit that you need help and you have done that I find omeprazole help if I take two at night then I do not have so much pain in the morning. I have never had nausea just the pain. I had my gallbladdr removed at end of April due to gallstones. I am better than I was but think I may have IBS. I have recently been diagnosed with a Hiatus Hernia. It is possible that a doctor will see you (if you need to be seen) even though you are not registered with them. Many people will be on holiday over Christmas after all. Take care and keep in touch Praying for you Sarah xxx  I had this for over a year. I didn't take any drugs for it ( I did initally but it didn't really work anyways), because I was of the belief that I needed to fix it naturally. So I didn't take any nexium ( I did initially) like my gastro suggested, because I feel things like Nexium just masks the issue and doesn't teach your stomach how to regulate acid etc So what worked? A strict diet I'm afraid. I did an chemical intolerace elimination diet intially and figured out lots of foods set me off. I keep to a strict diet now, so no spicy, acidic foods, no processed foods, no sauces etc. Doing that for a good 4 months got rid of the nausea. If I go back to eating a more processed diet, I get days here in there where my stomach is queasy, but mainly my stomach just goes erratic and becomes really inflamed. I still have IBS issues (mainly bloating, irregular stool, food sensitivites and unable to lose weight easily), but I am so releaved I don't have the nasea anymore, that was a nightmare. Also, this all started when I got a peptic ulcer. So maybe you have an ulcer or gastritis? After taking too much ibuprofen to treat migraines. I would go to an gastroenterologist and get Endoscopy done, to make sure everything is okay.  I have started feeling sick when I drink milk and some foods, I have had really bad back pain, headaches, stomach cramps,wind and constipation. The doctor has just referred me to see a nutritionist and dietician. Phone up the doctors surgery and say it is a emergency and explain your symptoms and say that you need to see a doctor straight away! "

However, immunocompromised - take S.Boulardii probiotic, could dangerous even fatal!!! On first day erythromycin I felt much better, diarrhoea stopped instantly, come back every 2 days week half.

Campylobacter made also lactose intolerant (which I found eating ice cream hot summer day.... Not pleasant surprise), I lactose free milk yogurts three weeks, back normal now. I also took multivitamins diarrhoea flushes lot nutrition body. I made sure I went even little walks fresh air evenings erythromycin agree sun artificial UV rays much.
