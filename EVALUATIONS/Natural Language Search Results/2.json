          " I am going through the same situation.I have panic attacks and depression. I have moved to a new country and I don't know many people here,I feel alone,I cant sleep at night and I just want to be normal again.I know it is not easy,I know howhat you feel but this is a challenge with ourselves, we should do the best to go out of this.even it is hard ,life is beautiful. Please don't ever think again to do sth to yourself.You are worth to live,to enjoy life.After the rain come the rainbow, there are such beautiful things that are waiting for you,just think positive. I am so sorry......I don't know what else to say...except hold on, because there are many people on here why will know how to try to help you. I just wish I could invite you to my house and give you an enormous hug as this year ends and the new one starts. Don't do anything drastic, give the new year a chance to change how you are feeling now. Pat xxxxxxx Hi kage words can be meaningless when you are in total despair. What i would say to you, firstly I am so pleased you did not act upon your feelings yesterday. In reading your post (twice over) it occurred to me that you are at a serious juncture in your life. By lining up the tablets and writing a note, I instantly recognised this action is more than a cry for help. Kate I cannot make you feel better by my words, but that will not deter me from trying!! I won't give you the usual patter, as I'm sure you have already heard this. What I would say is loneliness has a time frame, arguments with our partners, have a time frame, hurting so badly has a time frame. Importantly feeling so hopeless and unwell has a time frame too. You have been extremely brave by not harming yourself and trying to push through your pain. Even though you feel so helpless right now Kage, it's important for you to understand that you are truly loved by others. I am sure your partner will be in touch, our illness can be very hard on our loved one too. But right now you are concentrating on the 'what if' eg my partner fails to get in touch, or what if I am alone on new years eve etc. I know it's scary, but these worries may not come to pass. Rather than looking at empty rooms, imagine those rooms as rooms that are going to hold fun and laughter in! it may not be today, tomorrow etc..but it will come kage \u2665 right now you really need to reach out and get proper medical attention to alleviate your despair. Have you got a crisis line you can ring? It may help to talk things through with people that will be able to help with the compassion and respect you deserve. Please don't try to harm yourself again kage. ..We are all here for you \u2665 we sincerely care about you and your well being \u2665 I'm alone tonight as my depression hasn't been great today. So here for you all through the evening into the new year if you need me. god bless you xx  You may be alone, but there are hundreds of us on here thinking of you, willing you on and loving you. If you can't distract yourself from your feelings of despair maybe just don't try so hard, just cry it out. But please, please, please keep yourself safe. If you don't think you are safe call an ambulance, if you want to talk to someone maybe call the Samaritans? Please just keep holding on. 2016 could be your year! I will be thinking of you and hoping you are well. Lots of love and best wishes, xxxxx Ps have you considered contacting your partner? Maybe you can resolve things? I hope you can. xxxxx Thank you so much to everyone who replied. I am so touched by everything you have said. It helps to know one is not alone, and that others completely understand. I am going to reach out to my partner now. I hope they will be able to forgive me for my outburst. I wish I could hug all of you. New Years Eve is a ridiculous holiday, nothing is changing - tomorrow will come as it always has. Through my own experiences people put so much pressure on having a good night tonight yet it always seems to go wrong and ends up as a let down no matter what you're doing. I'm on my own tonight, was supposed to see a friend but she's too busy with work and my other friend has started seeing someone so they're busy being all lovey dovey. So I am totally alone tonight too Kage, nobody to call or speak to, I too can't stand TV and have difficulty concentrating. But it's ok, tonight is like every other night in my mind (not exactly good) but, I'm going to drink a bottle of red wine and lye in bed. I know a lot of people (who don't suffer from depression) but they've had their NYE plans fall through too, a lot of them have now wound up alone. It's just another night, there's nothing special about new years eve in reality so don't worry about it too much. If you can contact your partner and have a chat with him, maybe sort things out then that'd be wonderful, it may take some of the stress out. Do what you need to do to get through the night, everyone on this forum is here for you - keep posting, talk to us, we are here. xxxx Christmas and new year is just pooooooooooooo, so much pressure to be happy, you think everyone else is happy living there own full life, but its not true!!! there are alot of people struggling to get up in the morning, smoking rollie after rollie hoping to feel normal, but what is normal Good luck tonight, stay strong, thinking about you xx You say your partner does not care, yet your partner attended your appointment with you, if they did not care I doubt they would have bothered. Unfortunately it is not easy supporting someone with depression and anxiety, the people who do their level best to support them are often blamed and pushed away, I've seen my whole family ripped apart but my husband's refusal to seek help and treatment there are many worse situations than mine, people abused and threatened by their depressed partners. I know how you feel, yes I do, I've had years of anxiety, depression and agoraphobia and I got through it, the reason I got through it is I worked hard at getting better and wanted to get better, I am sure if you want to get through this you will, take care. Hi do your friends know what's happened with your partner? If not that's probably why they haven't contacted you. Why don't you ring and see what they are up to tonight and see if you can join them? I live on my own and few of my friends go out on NYE. I have text a couple who do but have had no reply. I am not in a very sociable mood anyway so will probably stay in. You won't by any means be the only person staying in tonight. The festive period can bring to the fore other problems and remind some people like me of how alone they really are. So put off this talk of taking your life until well afterwards and see how you feel. A big hug for you. Bev x Hey u, i been in your shoes many times. Please don't hurt yourself. Please. I would go this far and give u my personnel phone nr. just to talk to u so u feel less alone. i have no friends and know how it is when u feel so alone that it hurts. Trust me a lot of people been there. Just don't stop believing that u can fix this. U can !!! It can and will get better .....never give up. Let me know if u want to chat.....I'm here. Kage you are NOT ALONE! My god if I could count on one hand how I've had the exact same feelings, feeling alone,wanting to just end it all no support from those who say there only at the end of the phone, when you do pluck up the courage to ring they really arnt interested!, which hurts even more. In 2009 my husband of 25yrs just came in 2wks b4 Christmas telling me I've met someone else and I'm leaving you just like it in all 25yrs meant nothing to him,then our only son got married and for the 1st time in my life I was totally alone,my 1st Christmas was spent in bed alone and confused wondering what I'd done so wrong? Well the next year felt like hell one day I'd be ok the next I wouldn't go out for days unless it was to I have had cancer several times I've put my all in to getting better and being a good wife sadly nothing I could do or say made me feel better I'd go out to the gp or to get shopping I lost 3st in weight I've only got one kidney no bladder and have half of my insides missing, in fact when my husband came to see me in critical care after I'd had my bladder removed, the nurse pulled back the sheet to make sure I was ok, after that I never had a visit from him so yet again I was alone, I have seen so many shrinks,counsellors yet still all I wanted was to die yes and I meant it but I didn't have the guts to just take all my drugs and just go to sleep and never wake up again. I was on God knows how many antidepressants sleeping pills plus my usual morphine yet I wrote so many goodbye notes yet still I didn't have the guts to end it all. After 2yrs of hell I woke up on my birthday thinking how much bloody more can I take? One day I was up in London waiting to find out if I still needed treatment, this man sat beside me and started talking to me all I wanted was him to leave me alone!,in the end I politely told him I didn't feel like talking, he looked at me and said, look I'm not going to give you a lecture on god and all that nonsense but you look so lonely I just wanted to see if I could cheer you up. For some reason I looked at this man and told him what had happened in my life and I wished I were dead and yes I meant it, he looked at me told me his life story he'd been very wealthy and lost it all due to his illnesses then he gave me his e-mail address and told me, look you've been through hell so have I but if you ever want to just blow of steam msg me, I thought no chance your nice enough but no thanks! If resigned myself to being alone for the rest of my life. Several weeks later my house got flooded my mum and dad didn't want to know neither did my son, so I e-mailed this man told him I'd have to go into a b n b he told me get whatever you can get on a train and I'll meet you at the station I would never in a million years just do that! But I did he met me at the station I live in Hampshire he lives in London he met me the 1st thing I asked you don't have.a dog do you? Then he opened the door and this great big Rottweiler came towards me, I almost past out as I'm terrified of dogs, but over the weeks I got used to him plus this man had a full time carer so did I,but I couldn't go home for 18months as it took my housing association that long to fix my house!. To cut a boring story short I've been with this man almost 5yrs he knows about my issues and even though we are both ill (I'm now in renal failure and need a transplant) we are best friends and for the 1st time in my life I'm with a man I love (I never loved a man b4 I have always been bullied verbally and physically) now I'm with a man who gives me space when I'm down and who knows and understands me. Sorry if I've bored you to death all I can say is hang in there I've been gang raped abused and had other issues but at least I'm alive I now have a life not just an exsistance I'm still on antidepressants but I'm alive don't give up huni life is bloody hard but no matter where you go you'll find someone who understands just how your feeling I hope the new year is a better year for you Maria x Hello, I understand how it feels to be alone and lonely. I ost my husband to suicide and it was just after new year a few years ago, so this time of the year holds bad memories. I have daughters and was informed by text that they were together tonight with their partners and was informed about what they were eating. I had no invite and that hurts. They know i am on my own, infact most of my days are alone. So i know how it feels. I have tried everything over the years going to bed early, that don't work because the fireworks start early until at least 1am. one year i went for a walk round the block at midnight just so i could see people coming out the pubs and had one or two say happy new year, just to know that someone wished me a happy new year. Last year my daughter told me to get lost on new years eve in town, i cried so much and went to bed at 4pm only to not sleep through the whole evening. It will pass and a new day begins. Infact it is nearly new year, so i wish you and all the others that are lonely and alone tonight a Happier new year, I am about to watch the fireworks on BBC 1. Hugs xx "

          "I am alone for New Years Eve. I am sitting at home completely by myself. I don't even know where to begin with how I am feeling right now. I have a constant ache in my chest, my fingers are aching, I am on the verge of constant tears. I have a partner (maybe had), and we had an argument last night about their tendancies to sneak off to the pub. Me being me said I want them to leave me alone and only contact me again once they have their priorities in order. I have not heard anything since. I am now trying to come to terms with spending tonight by myself and starting the New Year alone. My partner knows of my depression and anxiety, they attended with me my last meeting with a psychiatric doctor at the local mental health centre and they were invited in at the end for a brief. Right now I feel like I have no one. No friends have reached out to me. No partner who cares. No family who are present. Last night I felt close to ending my life, closer than I have ever been. I wrote a suicide note, I collected all the medications in the house and lined them up. I did not go through with it, because I promised myself I would make one final push for the morning. The morning has been and gone and I am hurting so much I feel like each breath is ripping the hole in my chest further open. No amount of Google searches on how to spend tonight alone has helped. The advice given is meaningless. I read it and feel nothing. 'Read a book' - I cannot sit still 'Call a friend' - I have no one 'Watch TV and order pizza' - I am sick of TV and I have no appetite Meaningless to me. For the past 3 hours I have paced around the house feeling empty and lost. I stand in each room and gaze around and then return to my bed to hide. I wish I could build the courage to end my life. It feels like the better option. Is anyone else feeling like this? Has anyone else gone through this? I need some words from those who truly understand. I need someone to ease my mind."

          " As a male (77) I have had quite enough experience of depression during my life and witnessed others with the condition. In my young days the word depression was never used as that was thought to indicate a mental illness with all the bad associations that entailed. Then a doctor would refer to a breakdown of sorts or nervous anxiety (is there any other?). So I have from time to time given the problem a lot of thought most particularly as my son was brought home from uni with severe depression. The main feature appears to be an excess of stress. We all need a level of stress in order to perform normally so it is when the pressures build up to an unmanageable level of stress that a person can fall into depression. That leads to the first question - what has caused the rise in stress? Is it one event? A combination of events? A recurring problem that has gradually and insiduously worn the person down? Or something else - there can be a wide variety of reasons and all of us are susceptible under certain circumstances with possibly bereavement a major cause. Men and women are equally susceptible, but for differing reasons generally because we approach matters in a different way - lateral against vertical thinking, say. What both sexes experience at times is a depression brought on by a trigger. It may be that something in a person's past has been suppressed and suddenly an action, event, memory triggers that high stress/anxiety and hence depression. From your comments it seems to me that your boyfriend is being affected by a trigger. What is it? I cannot say but you may well know although you have not yet made the connection. He needs some medical help from his GP. That will not cure the depression; what the drugs do is to help him by reducing the impact of stress and allow his brain to refresh. That is to allow time to overcome the negative thoughts that are a severe part of depression. Both of you can then help in the recovery process. Positive thinking is a strong way to help oneself overcome the bad thoughts. It requires discipline and determination but the more positivity that can be introduced the quicker can be the recovery. So the meds are there to help but if only the meds are relied upon then recovery may take a very long time. Recovery is not something that happens suddenly. One may realise one day that one feels much better but recovery is still some way away. That is why it is important not to stop the meds without seeing the GP first. Some people have experienced such bad depression that they need to continue taking the meds forever. However, I believe that even those could be helped and the longer they are in that condition the harder it may be to break out of it. Consequently getting help as soon as possible makes a lot of sense. You have an important role to play but do not push it. Being there and encouraging is a start but he cannot be forced to do anything. A visit to his GP uis the best you can do first. MALE 43 married with twins at age 15. I have been severely depressed for a year now. I am much better than I was but still not completely well. I never could talk about it face to face. I found these forums and online support help some. My wife tries to get me to talk but I will not. She made me go to my doctor but I wouldn't talk to him either but she did. I could have strangled her. It was the worst most humiliating thing I have ever been through. She even told of bout with suicide when she found me in the yard with a 44 magnum. But like I said months later after many meds and such, I am better  My reasons for been depressed have been mentioned in my first post but without making you read all that the main reasons are that I was raped, I've constantly been betrayed an cheated on by girlfriend's, I was bullied at school, don't get on with family and I was dragged away from my home to a place I hate. Mind you that's just the big reasons the small reasons would be stress related like not been able to get a job or a girlfriend for that fact and family pestering me to be someone I'm not. As for what helps at school it was playing the piano or reading true crime books at home which I'm thankful to John E Douglas and his mindhunter, cases that still haunt us an broken wings books. Now I'm 31 what helps to drown it all out is playing on the Xbox with friends over Xbox live but for me it don't go anywhere sure I can hide my depression from most people I know but it's still there. Because meds never worked the side effects did but not the positive effects so I'm still looking for a pill that might work. Hi Alotte, I'm 36 and have only recently admitted to both myself and my other half that I am suffering with depression and probably have been for at least a couple of years. Like you, my other half has wondered if there has been something wrong for some time, and I would have continued to deny and suppress it had she not confronted me about it and told me how she was feeling about things. I don't know why I am depressed - there's no specific event I can pick out that would be a 'reason' as it were - I think it has just crept up on me through stress and the way I (don't) deal with things emotionally. I haven't yet been able to fully open up to my wife - we have talked a bit, but it's like there's something physically stopping me from inside from saying what's going on in my head - hard to explain. I also think I've learned to 'keep up appearances' for so long that it's not something I can just suddenly change - so even now when my wife asks if I'm ok, I automatically just say 'not bad' or similar and she gets angry that I'm not telling her the truth. It hurts me too that I can't seem to just be honest, but that's the way it is right now and I can't help it. I have managed to get myself to the GP and get some meds to help, and have started the process of trying to get some talking therapy as well - ultimately I want to get better, I see the impact of me being the way I am on my family and want to change that, particularly to get some enjoyment out of my children again which has been lacking for ages now. So I think the thing that is helping me overcome it is admitting I need help in the first place and then trying whatever I can to improve things. It's not a quick thing to recover from, but I have to believe I will get there. Hope this helps. Good luck. Man, 60. Mine began when my family died. Mother, father and wife all within a few months. Left with 7 year old son who asked me to kill him. 'Friends' deserted as fast as possible. Decided my life was over but couldn't kill myself because it would leave my son with no-one. Anyway, I wanted to say that being depressed affected me as a man. My stereotype of being a man was that we don't cry, we must be strong. Women will think we are weak (which they do) if we are weeping and pathetic and can't cope. They want someone they can rely on and who can protect them and probably support them. When depressed I was no fun, very pathetic, crying, angry, oversensitive and negative. Who wants to be around someone like that? (i thought). Also my sex drive died. So I didn't talk to anyone about it because 1) they wouldn't understand and 2) I would be judged. It totally undermined my feeling of being a man and enhanced my feeling of failure. Also, I guess I expected my women friends to be supportive and 'motherly' and empathic. They weren't. Reality wake up call! All I got was them telling me how I should bring up my son as if I was an idiot who didn't know how to do that.In my experience, men dont talk about depression because of shame of being less of a man and fear of being judged. This is apart from the usual depression scenario of retreat from the world and from others. He needs anything that can give him self-esteem and, excuse me, but sex can help him feel this. He may fear that you will get fed up with him and leave (which a lot of women do) so doesn't want to tell you how bad he is really feeling. However, there is an opportunity here for you to get closer. Don't tell him what to do. Try to ignore him shutting you out. It is the depression that is shutting you out, not him. He may also feel that he is not worthy of you. Try to show him that you still value him and that this is a temporary situation which he will recover from. Best of luck to you both. Male, 52. Had depression for over 5 years. Had breakdown at work by minor incident that tipped me over the edge. My manager suggested i visit the doctor which i delayed but did actually go. Cause - delayed reaction by 2 years of mum's sudden death and being a good listener, i had been strong for my siblings and in my youth, also for my friends, 3 of whom were adopted. Following on from this an ex girlfriend and good friend died suddenly of brain cancer followed the next year by my elderly father. Live alone with plenty of time to think. Being stubborn by nature i searched the internet for support therapies and have so far tried hypnotherapy, cranial, reflexology and most importantly counselling. I am not ashamed of this illness and will willingly educate the ill informed. It is a form of mental illness which means it is invisible to the outside world. You certainly find out who your true friends are. I also did something very foolish in my 20's (sliding 1500ft down a mountain after ending a best friendship at the top of it. This was not a suicide attempt but just that my mind was not functioning properly. This has left me with lasting injuries which give me pain every day. Everyone reacts in different ways to depression - some people will talk about it and then recoil into their shell, others feel too embarrassed or humiliated to even discuss it. I would highly recommend firstly a visit to a doctor, medication in tandem with counselling. I'm not the sort of person who wanted to talk to a stranger about my innermost feelings and my 1st counsellor was hopeless. I found the 2nd 1 privately who is excellent. You have to find someone who you can have a rapport and be comfortable with. You are doing your best. Be there for him and support him when he will let you. Best wishes and i hope he can find the courage to find the help he needs.  Hi to all you guys above. Just a brief note to one and all. Depression can hit anyone even the person one least expects to succumb. There is no known reason that fits everyone but the major factor is excess stress and/or sudden devastating change. being a man does not change anything as any GP will tell you. There is, however, a difference between feeling depressed and being in clinical depression. People who have never experienced depression are more likely to barrack a man than a woman. Empathy comes from someone who cares, not from strangers except in unusual circumstances. You need to talk to your closest friend, if unmarried, not to anyone you happen to know and particularly not to women who are merely acquaintances. I have written a lot on a number of threads here undere depression some of which may help you so try to read as much as you can because I cannot go on repeating myself. I'd like to thank you all for your replies. I have showed my boyfriend your replies which was very emotional for him but it was important for him to see that he wasn't alone (which he has now seen first hand). We're going to visit the GP and discuss how he has felt recently. We're also going to make a list of things that he thinks has triggered this. As someone I want to spend my life with, I want to support him as much as possible. Although I suffer with bouts of depression myself (which I'm self-aware of and able to manage), I know first hand that it isn't easy to support someone with very severe depression (this coming from someone who had a severely depressed, suicidal mother whilst growing up). It's hard to see someone give up on themselves but I think I have the advantage of experiencing it before as well as understanding it on the most part and I'm not going to let it get to a stage where it is out of control. I just want to say to those who have had people leave or not understand, it may not be from lack of care or malice, it is awful for those affected by depression but also their loved ones who experience the effects of it. You need someone strong willed, understanding and aware of how depression works. I know it's hard not to but don't take it personally if someone can't stick by you or understand. What I was really asking though, although GP's, therapy and medication are the best bets, do any of you have personal ways of dealing with it or if you have anything that helps you manage? Mine used to be work (I have a job where I have to put on a persona), I'd focus on that for most of my waking hours that I didn't have time to focus on other things. In my boyfriend's circumstances, I think that is causing additional stress making the depression worse. I know they don't cure depression, I just want to know what coping mechanisms you use? Thanks again. Fresh air and exercise, a change of scenery, a change of accommodation and even a change of job can all help one to cope. A new challenge particularly when it involves leaving the old behind. Best of all, I believe, is positive thoughts. Concentrate on all the good things in life. Plan for the future. Think of what you would really like to do even if that seems impossible; the impossible often becomes possible due to changes you cannot foresee. Then dream about it. All of the above helps to drive out negative thoughts. I find using mind over matter helps enormously - such as I am not going to let it beat me, repeated over and over while doing strong exercise. All of us can help ourselves when we get some med that gives us a start. The last time I went down I soon realised that I could not get a good sleep. Although frowned upon my GP relented and gave me some sleeping pills. After a few nights sleeping deeply I regained the energy to tackle the problem with exercise and positive thinking. Getting out of the house and having contact with other people (even just going down to the cornershop). Keeping occupied with something (anything). (I built a model ship) Praising oneself for achieving anything during the day (even if it is just the washing up). Watching comedy programmes. Listening to radio 4 extra. Taking a long warm bath by candlelight Meditating. Going for a walk in nature. Stroking a cat or dog. Drawing, writing or painting how I feel. Do a body scan daily (this helps take you out of your head and into your body) Do not beat yourself up for being depressed. Write down your depressive thoughts. Be very kind and gentle with yourself (more than you think you should) Get a furry hot water bottle (very comforting) Rest. Say to yourself 'I love you' Listen to music Buy yourself a little treat. Get a pair of sheepskin slippers. Don't drink alcohol (it's a chemical depressant) Don't smoke weed (it is also a depressant) Have sex (with yourself if no one is available) Don't google depression (or any other imaginary illness) Don't listen to the advice of those who don't know what they are talking about. Every day bring to mind what you DO have. (a roof and walls to keep out the weather; clean hot and cold water that comes out of the wall on demand; an indoor toilet; warmth on demand;clean clothes; food available from all over the world; family and loved ones; friends, pets etc.)  Adding to the above posts which contains information i agree with: Write lists of things to do, however minor, and cross them off when done - very satisfying. I'm clearing my loft at the moment. Sit in the sun (when it shines). If you are having a bad day - go with the flow. The next day will probably be better. Listen to music - i have different genres depending on mood. Look at You Tube videos. Have plenty of 'me' time. Good luck.  Well I have messed up my knee and hurt really bad yesterday. I think i over medicated and this morning I got in a wreck and tore up my truck. My luck  I just wanted to thank you all for all of your replies. They have really helped and I've started to compile a wish list to sit down and cross off with my boyfriend. I think that not only has it become too much for him in terms of stress which is having a knock on effect with his depression, he's not had a lot to look forward to which I want to work on, for the both of us. We did go to the GP and although my boyfriend couldn't raise the subject for fear of breaking down in front of him, his options were discussed once the subject was broached. The GP happily referred him to see a counsellor and rightly informed him that medication was a choice for him - some people respond to just one or the other and some people need both. So we're hoping he can start the counselling and see how well that works for him to start with. I know this isn't an overnight thing and it is a process that may take years but I hope this is a great start to better times. I will say that as soon as we spoke to the GP about it, my boyfriend seemed significantly happier like there was some hope for him and he was starting to understand himself more. So anyone who feels like their depression is worsening and needs help, please don't be afraid to speak to your GP - I know that even when I raised my issues with my GP (who hasn't had the best bedside manner in the past) they were really understanding. Thanks again. P.S: Mtm, sorry to hear about your truck. I've been working on looking for 'silver linings' in my own life recently. It's hard but there is always something to be thankful for. I write them down so I'm now starting to compile a list of them to look at. I understand your boyfriend's fear of talking and approaching the subject as well. I couldn't do it either but my wife did and told the doc everything. It was a very emotional and disturbing visit but I guess it paid off. I am better. I still struggle keeping this thing at bay. It is like a creature that keeps trying to come out from under the bed and you have to willfully keep tucking it back it. Your boyfriend is very lucky to have such a caring and thoughtful person. Just as I was to have my wife. Do keep in mind that sometimes no matter how hard you try, it is a tough road and he can bring you down and put you in a spot where you are no help to him. I pretty much did that to my wife. Be strong and cautious of letting him, not meaning to, bring you down. Good luck to you both. Regards, Todd Mozingo"

          "My boyfriend who has been feeling rather 'down' the last couple of weeks. This is coupled with crying, guilt, feeling worthless, confused, unmotivated, tired, etc. As someone who has bouts of bad anxiety and depression, I understand that he's going through a period of depression himself. Over the last 6 months, I have kept pushing for my boyfriend to see his friends and family but he doesn't want to. When he does, he seems to brighten up a bit and feel thankful that he did but I feel bad for harassing him about it in the first place. We've been together and lived together quite a while now but I've never noticed any symptoms of his depression (although I know it was quite bad in the past before we met). I digress, I wanted to know how many members were males suffering with depression and what (if anything) triggered your depression? Is there anything that makes you feel better or anything that helps you overcome it? Also, do you ever feel like you can talk to anyone about it? My boyfriend talks to me about it briefly but then shuts me out, just as I am in that metaphorical door by saying 'I'm just being stupid, sorry, ignore me.' Thanks!"

          " My anxiety is that bad to I really haven't left my house for several months either I'm at a loss on what to do myself Hi, Lauren: I'm so sorry that your body is in such torture. I was just like you and the others on here many years ago. You have, I'm certain, a chemical imbalance causing agoraphobia, a fear of leaving your home, and especially your bedroom. That is what you call your \"safety zone\"...Now, what you have to do is..tell yourself that going out the door is NOT going to hurt you in any way. Start by going out on your porch or yard and breathe the fresh air...Be proud of yourself for doing that much. The next day, take a few more baby steps out and take deep breaths, realizing that all the other people out there are not being hurt by being out of their homes. Just keep going like that until you finally make it to the grocery store, or shopping...even if your knees knock together and your heart beats faster, it won't kill you...please keep that in mind...Before you know it, you will be out and about, for which you should be very proud. As I have told all the others on here, depression and anxiety have minds of their own...You MUST NOT give into it or you will be a prisoner in your own home forever. Please try what I said..that is how I overcame years of staying in my bed...I am 67 yrs. old now, and yes, I still get scared at times, but don't let that illness ruin your wonderful, young life...Please keep in touch....I really do care about all of you who suffer!! I'm sorry Lauren but so glad you actually put how you feel if writing. I recently was given temporarily custom of my 6 year old grandchild. I panicked because I knew not only would I have to take her to school where there's hundreds of ppl, I'd have to take her to parks and places where there's thousands of ppl. I do it and I'm sweating, freaking out sometime sometimes to point of crying. If I keep her till she's 18, the thought of proms etc blow my mind. Are you getting out now? What advice helped? We are not alone. I have been there. And I have come out of it. It takes a while and it is very uncomfortable but you slowly have to leave your house and go somewhere close by and stay even when the anxiety comes. Do not let yourself run away from it. And little by little it will get better. Take deep breaths and trying breathing in for 4 seconds and out for 4 seconds. Breathing slow and focusing on breathing during a bad attack has helped me a ton. Also watch the tapping for panic attacks video by julie schiffman on youtube and do it. And although it's very hard try not to focus on your anxiety, it does help. Also exercise and water has helped relieve it a ton! Oh and one more tip, Rescue Remedy pastilles and mouth spray works really good to take the edge off, they sell it on amazon or at CVS. I have tried a lot of things and these tips have really helped me. You can make it better take it slowly and just try one step at a time! You are not alone!  That's how I feel right now I know this thread is old but glad I found it I've been so lightheaded and anxious I've been bedridden afraid leaving the house to go to the doctor  <p>Hey Lauren, </p><p></p><p>I have had the same as you since I was 15. I know where my comes from as my mum was very messed up and she did some crazy things and made do some. My dad the same, he abused me. I was in and out of care homes. I was abused by family friend. When I was 10 I was abused aswell by friends granddad. And agin a few other times...it&#39;s awful. I&#39;m so scared of leaving the house unless I&#39;m with someone. I also get parra about the people in my St, they must think im crazy or something. I moved up from Devon 20 months ago on my own. I do not talk any member of my family. And will never again. I&#39;m 39. I can&#39;t work although would love to. I have done and studied and somehow got through it all! But even then people noticed my ways! I shake at times when talking to people. I only leave the house to go docs and shrinks. My eating has come to a stop atm..my mental health has been bad the last few weeks. Something will trigger it off. The esa and DLA give me very little to live off and think it&#39;s wrong as I need help getting around by cab and taxis are so expencive up here. I don&#39;t know no one up here and in a small village with clicky peeps. I&#39;m on a new anti depression tab but going to call docs and get on higher dose. Plus get some valium to help me if she will give. I don&#39;t want to have to get them off the black market as I don&#39;t know if they are the real thing. It cost me &#163;40 in taxi both ways to see shrink and I just can&#39;t afford it. IVE tried to get a move close to a town and not this village so fingers crossed. The bus is every hour to the nearest town! It really is not good living here and really getting me down. I&#39;m always on my own. Day in and out. I can&#39;t read as don&#39;t have the concerntation nor can I watch much TV as its so boring. I never wash not brush my teeth. I&#39;m so low been thinking of ending it all for the last 6 months. I have no partner. I moved away from where I&#39;m from as my ex stabbed me in the twice. I had my baby taken away and she was moved up to her gran (father side) she has only allowed me to see my baby 4 times in 3y 8m and that has only been this year!! She has been awful to me. I had a breakdown and tried to end my life. I can&#39;t talk to no one but my doc and shrink about how I feel. I am smoking so many fags it&#39;s awful! I&#39;m looking shadow of my former self. If I can move to the same town as my daughter I will be able to see her every other weekend and then after a year she can come home. It&#39;s so cruel on my daughter and myself as my daughter loves me dearly. And she begs to see me. Her gran has now blocked my number as the last time I called my daughter was crying so much to see me. I bought a kitten to keep me company but all she does is wreak my home! I just don&#39;t know what to do anymore. I have some hope that they move me close to my daughter as im still 45 miles away and getting to see her is either &#163;50 in cab each way or bus which is every hour then to wait at a city to go to another city on bus and that is every hour and I have contact at 10am in the morning. She won&#39;t change the times. And keeps on lying. It&#39;s my daughters birthday in sunday and I shall be going with her gifts to her grans but I fear her gran will start shouting again but if she does that on my daughters birthday I swear I&#39;ll take it further as this is just getting me down so so much. All I need is some help and support and im not getting nothing. I pray for a better day every day! Thinking this is only a blip but nothing seems to be happening. I know that by seeing my daughet more will give me some confidence and make lots happier but can not be done where im living as too far away. The woman next door just screams and shouts at her children all day long. It makes me so sad to hear. I sit in the dark. I drive myself crazy as I know I should not be living like this. But IVE been having anzity for so so Lon and my thoughts are just negative. I just need people to talk to me and maybe help me through my none life!! IVE been put down all my life by my family and im used to it. I have such low self esteem. Can&#39;t leave house. Always skint. So unhappy. I&#39;m gonna call docs and get valium and sleepers as can&#39;t keep on like this. I hope you can stay in contact with me x thanks for listening x</p> <p>I&#39;m so very much in that place. IT HURTS!! I&#39;d always been so strong. Now I cannot even go to a doctor&#39;s appointment. It&#39;s physically painful &amp; I can&#39;t catch my breath 90% of the time. Humiliating doesn&#39;t begin to cover it. I&#39;m lost &amp; wanting to get help but have no clue how I can do that when I can&#39;t think of leaving my home</p> <p>Lauren. I hope you see from all the replies that we are not alone. MANY ppl have the same problems and won&#39;t admit it to another, not even themselves. But, look at all of us, not only do we acknowledge it, we talk about it and free ourselves. Let us none forget YOU ARE NOT ALONE AND NEVER EVER EVER GIVE UP!!!</p> Hey Lauren You are definitely not alone. Citalopram has helped me a lot. You can do this. Breathing excersies work as well. Keep positive keep trying new things . YOU WILL beat this. Good luck  <p>Hi Lauren, have you contacted your local mental health crisis team? They may be able to help you, are you taking your meds as prescribed including diazepam.&#160;</p><p>Your GP should refer you to see a psychiatrist to help you, review meds, organise talking therapy so you need to go to the GP even though you are scared.</p><p>I know your safe zone is your bedroom but staying there is not healthy for you, baby steps are needed even if it&#39;s 10 mins in the living room and building up from there.</p><p>Regarding having a mental breakdown I&#39;m afraid to say that you&#39;ve already had one, your brain chemistry is unbalanced but there is help to get it back to done thing normal but it starts with you being brave and seeing your GP again.</p><p>Go for it girl.</p><p>&#160;</p>"

          "my anxiety has gotten so bad that I can't leave my house. I've been in my house (never really leaving my bedroom as it's the only place I feel safe) for two months. I can't even go to the doctors which is a 30 second drive from my house. i wish I could explain how badly I feel. I cry constantly, I have no friends and my family don't understand why I am like this and I am really scared I'm going to end up having a mental breakdown. At least three times a day I am in the corner of my bathroom rocking back and forth sweating, crying, racing heart, feeling the need to run but I have no where to run too. I am literally stuck and I can't pick myself back up. I have no idea what to do, I don't want to go to the doctors because I'm scared and I am already on so much medication (venlafaxine, mirtazipine, diazepam and propranolol) I wake up every two hours in a cold sweat panicking... I don't know what to do.. How do I get help? Who do I talk to about getting the help I need?"

          " Thank you for taking the time to share such an in depth recounting of your recovery experience .. and how well prepared you were for it all ! It IS such an emotionally vulnerable time when you feel you are not in the regular world, in limbo. I am in week 5, cast on for another week. Still a road ahead.. cheers ! <p>De 331e</p><p></p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Thanks you for sharing your experience, mine seems a bit out there compared to many I have read. Wanting to finish the following season I waited.</p><p></p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; May 7, 2018 the only instruction I received was given me when I left the hospital. You all seem to have better information doctors than myself. I have been to many surgeries with my daughter and the doctors had always explained the procedure. I had no idea what to expect and it&#39;s probably my own fault as I&#39;ve had no surgeries except to arthroscopic surgeries on my knee and councils removed at 14.</p><p></p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I am 68 years old and have been athletic most of my life with no kids at home though I raised five. &#160;My husband and I are self-employed. The night after my surgery the bandage kept coming loose I fixed as best I could. There was a large blood spot and it felt like the bandage was stuck to my stitches. I went into the office the next morning they change the bandage and took x-rays. Imagine my surprise when I saw a steel plate and three screws in my big toe joint. Still the doctor gave no explanation of the procedure, all he said was it looked good. I could now shower (I use an antibacterial soap still do and now use Neosporin) the first week I used a walker and went to work second day via my daughter driving and picking me up. Being that we are self-employed I do not have anyone who could cover the office for me.</p><p></p><p>&#160;Read online that you could drive after the second week central myself to work wearing a shoe given to me by someone the same surgery. I cut the toes of sox and a gauze pad over the stitches.</p><p></p><p>May 16, 2008 doctors appointment more x-rays still doing good.</p><p></p><p>May 30, 2018, more x-rays stitches removed sadly they had grown into the newly healed skin, quite painful and seek for a week. Still doctor swears everything looks good I finally told him I was surprised it was done. His answer\u2026 What did you expect? You said you were going to fix it. I fixed it the said I had to put the metal in there to hold the bones together. (The explanation was a little late ) The incision only looked worse and was again draining. I could not put any pressure on the top of my foot so even the shoe hurt.</p><p></p><p>June 14, 2018 month for the swollen and red around the top of the incision. I called the doctor&#39;s office and they are not in today would have to drive 30 miles. The nurse told me to send her a picture which I did. Her reply was doctor wants you to go to the ER. I have to go to urgent care which is less timely weight where they did prescribing an antibiotic.</p><p></p><p>June 20 and went into see the doctor took more x-rays I asked about the heavy scabbing, he said that they would come off on their own not to pick at them. My big toe is known but still hurts when touched and yes feels like walking on stones in the ball of my foot. And like you the area is angry and red. From what I have read I probably did too much too soon but the doctor gave me no restrictions other than the weight bearing only to walk on my heel. So many conflicting thoughts and online information, my next appointment will be July 11.</p><p></p><p>I cannot wear any shoe other than the one prescribed but I do crochet so I made a pair of slippers out of flip-flops works great and much cooler.</p><p></p><p>Thank you for your journey through your experience too late I am informed. Wishing you the best Kay, Sorry this is also a lengthy</p><p></p><p>&#160;</p><p></p><p>&#160;</p> Thank you for sharing your experience! We get the general info from the doctor, but smaller details such as the ride home, the showering tactics and dry skin issues are also super helpful! Hi De Wow this is so great . I am scheduled Oct 11 for bunion and hammer tie surgery and am petrified ! I had a partial knee replacement may of 15 and that went great and finally this year just getting back into my power walking routine and feeling normal again . Now to start over not a nice thought . I was told I could go back to work at two weeks as long as I can elevate ( which I can ) but I\u2019m thinking , reading your story ) that seems unrealistic . I am self employed really can not stay away for more than that . So many people say if foot does not hurt don\u2019t have surgery which is my case . But it looks awful :( and getting very difficult to buy shoes . ( you understand this !) I too am very active , have small grandchildren that I watch at different times and don\u2019t want be laid up again. Your recovery was / is seemingly very long . Maybe I just forgot all I went through with the knee recovery . Anyway I have friends that have had this surgery and say to get it done . I just don\u2019t know , so want to cancel . My natural doctor I see said he has seen more failed foot surgeries than any other surgery . He said re-aligning foot bones , with the ankle , and leg is not easy . It made a lot of sense . Well anyway that is my story , maybe you could offer some wisdom ! Thank you snd continued success in your recovery . Debbie  Omg, I will definitely be getting a basket for my scooter, LOL! I hope my recovery is as smooth as youres, De33ie. I have a positive outlook, so I hope that will help me heal and get around faster :) Hello, I realize this thread is 3 yrs old, but maybe someone still can help by sharing personal experience to the following question - is ist true that you can't fully extend the foot anymore after lapidus surgery? I have a bunion and loose TMT joint that had never caused any problems although I had been a semi-professional dancer for two decades and have always practiced \"foot-intensive\" sports. Since an injury two yrs ago this has dramatically changed, my right foot has developed major problems in everyday and work life to a degree that renders a surgical solution inevitable, However, I was told I could never go back to dancing (ballet) afterwards because of lacking ability to extend the foot as I used to be able to and as necessary for ballet. Dancing is my everything (even if I can barely do it right now anymore anyway - but hope ) so I really fear to undergo this \"surgery of no return\". Is there anyone out there to confirm/deny this from personal experience? Despite, what about other sports like running or aerobics? Thanks in advance for any input!  Hi, My name is Emilia. On 2015 i had surgery on my right foot- bunion and hammertoe. After that many years i still feel that is something not normal there (its not painful, but not combatable, something that was not done correct, something not like the foot before surgery). I'm very active person- running and like to enjoy my life. Now i developed the same problem on my left foot bunion and hammertoe with corn, which is very painful. I have a question: How do you fill after the surgery? Like normal person who never had that surgery and can run and enjoy his life? I'm so scare to do not become disable? Thanks Emilia"

I\u2019m a married mother of 2 and a stay at home grandmother of 2 children ages 6 and 8 yrs. old. I have never had to have a cast before and the only surgery I&#39;ve ever had was a tonsillectomy when I was 11 years old.</p><p>I\u2019ve had bunions for years (due to being flat footed and wearing high heals) and it was to the point that my right foot\u2019s toes were becoming crooked and when I stepped on my foot, it felt like I was stepping on a large stone just under the toes on the bottom side, the ball of my foot.&#160; My second toe was arching downward, hurting and not lying flat anymore and was above and slightly over my great toe. It was now a \u201chammer toe\u201d.</p><p>Preparation prior to the day of surgery my doctor had told me to do calf stretching exercises, so a couple of months before surgery I made sure to do those daily. I pre-paid bills and made sure laundry was caught up. I froze portions of meals a few weeks prior for easier meal preparation later on and posted a list of what was in the freezer for others to see. My husband scheduled vacation time for the week after surgery and my daughters were also available to help. We also had my prescription for the pain medicine filled prior to the day of surgery, which was Norco 10/325. We bought an All-Terrain knee scooter which turned out to be a Godsend! I did practice on the scooter and the tires did put tire marks on the floors but cleaned off easily enough and we also removed the area rugs from the floors of our single story (thank goodness) home.&#160; I bought pants that would stretch easily to fit over my cast.&#160; I also made sure to increase my water intake a couple of days before surgery for easier IV placement. My husband placed a medium sized cardboard box upside down over the foot of my side of our bed with the flaps tucked under the mattress but over the covers to protect my foot from the cat in case she were to jump up onto that area as she likes to do. We also put wedge pillows under the covers to raise the covers high enough to keep the covers from tugging on my foot. We re-arranged furniture to clear the path for the scooter and placed night lights in darker areas of the house. I put things I would need in the basket of the scooter and I also attached a grabber to my scooter with a small bungie cord. I made sure to have a laniard to wear around my neck with my cell phone attached if I happened to be at home alone for any amount of time.</p><p>For my showers I would wrap my cast in a standard kitchen sized garbage bag with a large rubber band just past the top of the cast to keep out any water. I placed a step stool in the shower to sit on&#160; and hung my leg over the edge of the bathtub and closed the shower curtain over the top of my leg and used the hand held shower sprayer.</p><p>&#160;[b]On February 1, 2018[/b] I had \u201cLapidus\u201d surgery on my right foot to correct bunion and a hammer toe on the second toe.&#160; I had to have General anesthesia because the condition of my foot was considered extensive and would take 2 hours to repair. They gave me something for nauseousness about an hour before the surgery and about thirty seconds before taking me to surgery they gave me something to relax me, they said it was similar to what Tequila does to you.&#160; :-) I felt that take affect as I was being wheeled into the operating room.&#160; The last thing I remember was them putting the mask for the anesthesia over my mouth and nose. Things went as expected during the surgery. They put in two screws in the top of my foot and a long pin in the second toe to correct the hammer toe. The next thing I remember I was in recovery and the nurse was telling me it was over and I could wake up now, needless to say I didn\u2019t want to so I fell back to sleep and she told me once again that I could wake up now. That time I managed to open my eyes and look around and was dizzy and a little nauseous. The nurse asked me how I felt and I told her I was nauseous from the dizziness and she said I was pretty pale and would give me something for the nauseousness. I reminded her they gave me something before surgery and she said it obviously wasn\u2019t enough and that it would be okay to give me more. The more awake I became, the more the nurse commented on how my color was getting better. They wheeled a portable x-ray machine to my bed and took x-rays of my foot and then my husband came in and helped me to the wheelchair and got me to the restroom where I got dressed. I was told I wouldn\u2019t be able to put any weight at all on my foot for six weeks. They gave me crutches and sized them about six inches from below my armpits so that they didn\u2019t reach all the way up into my underarms to keep them from making my underarms from getting too sore.&#160; After I got the okay from the doctor I was released.</p><p>On the ride home, I made the mistake of riding in the front seat of the car (2012 Toyota Highlander). I ended up putting my foot up on the dashboard of the car so as not to put too much pressure on the plaster cast\u2019s heal area in case it wasn\u2019t dry enough yet. (I was too nauseous to have my husband pull over so I could get in the back seat, I just wanted to get home and it would only take about 20 minutes to get there). For future rides in the car I would sit in the back seat facing forward behind the folded down front passenger seat with my leg propped up on it which seemed to be the most comfortable.</p><p>After we got home I rode my knee scooter from the garage to the bedroom. I was still a little nauseous so I just wanted to get into bed. After I settled into bed I ate something so I could take my pain medicine then went to sleep for about four hours. They told me to keep my foot propped up &quot;nose to toes level&quot;&#160; to reduce the swelling and to put an ice pack under my knee so as to reduce the pain and I should do this often and anytime there is any swelling. I was shaky the first night from the anesthesia still being in my system. The doctor had said I could take Aleve for inflammation and the Norco for pain, however, I would need to space taking those two medications a couple of hours apart. We kept a list of my medication schedule so there would be no second guessing of the times taken.</p><p>[b]For the first couple of days after surgery, [/b]my foot didn\u2019t hurt much at all due to the fact that the anesthesia was still in my system. (This is where I\u2019ll mention the embarrassing fact about the smell of my urine, but hey we all do it.) For the few days after the surgery my urine had a strange odor which, to my understanding was the anesthesia being flushed out of my body. While I\u2019m on the subject, wearing no undies made it much easier to maneuver when needing to use the toilet. I was also more emotional for the first several days which is a side affect of the pain medicine they gave me at the hospital. One concern I had was sleeping then waking up to get up in the middle of the night and forgetting I had just had foot surgery (thankfully, that never happened). A few times my toes made painful involuntary movements while sleeping which woke me up and that was painful but it only lasted a few seconds. &#160;</p><p>The Norco caused major constipation so I ate Fiber granola bars &amp; a stool softener with every pain pill which was very helpful.&#160; I was concerned with becoming dependent on the pain medication (I don\u2019t like taking any kind of medication that\u2019s not absolutely necessary) so after the first several days I took half the dose (instead of 10 mg, I took 5 mg) of the pain pills for a couple of weeks then halved again for the next couple of weeks. I took none after cast came off until I started walking on the boot, then I just took the&#160; smaller amount,&#160; 2.5 mg during the day and the 5.0 mg at night, then gradually tapered off all together (which is what is supposed to be done but they don\u2019t tell you that part).</p><p>[b]On Feb. 13, 2018 [/b](1 week &amp; 5 days after surgery) I had the first (post-surgery) cast removed and the stitches taken out from the hammer toe (the bunion stitches were self-dissolving so they were still there) with more tape added to the hammer toe incision and a fiberglass cast put on. The pin in the hammer toe was left in for 4 more weeks. (I hadn\u2019t taken any pain medicine prior to this visit since the night before but should have as it was a little painful having the stitches removed.)</p><p>[b]On March 13, 2018[/b] (4 weeks &amp; 4 days after surgery)&#160; Much to my relief I had the fiberglass cast removed, x-rays taken while lying on a table and the pin removed from the hammer toe! Getting the stitches taken out hurt more than getting the pin taken out,&#160; believe it or not.&#160; I did feel some discomfort when the pin was being pulled past the knuckle area but not for long (on a pain scale of 1-10 with 10 being the most painful, my pain was a 2). The tape that was on the bunion incision was left on.&#160; At this time I was given a walking boot (soft cast) and was told that I could walk short distances but should continue using scooter/crutches for long distances. I wore Skechers Shape Ups on my good foot because it\u2019s a taller than the average tennis shoe so it matched the boot\u2019s elevation. &#160;</p><p>I didn\u2019t experience nearly as much pain after the cast came off as I did while in the cast. Most of my foot was numb for the&#160; first couple of days and bruised on the sides and bottom and the second toe was especially painful on the bottom and tip and very sensitive to be touched. What I had felt as pain while wearing the cast was the tape they had put over the incisions digging into my skin much of the time. I had been moving my toes around in the cast because it felt like the gauze that was lining the inside of the cast was stuck in between and under my toes on the bottom side of my foot. We discovered the night my cast was removed that it was dried skin \u2018chunks\u2019. There was also a surprising amount of dried, flaky skin from below my knee where the cast came up to but was especially worse on my foot and under and around the bends of my toes. The skin on my foot was extremely dry &amp; burning in spots, it felt like it would crack if I could\u2019ve bent my toes enough. I cleaned my foot and toes off with Q-tips (the doctor said to let the hole where the pin was heal for a couple of days before showering) then applied Vaseline to my whole foot and leg where the cast was, which worked wonders. We noticed my calf was skinnier than my other one as the calf muscle was atrophied some. The pain from this surgery wasn\u2019t as bad as the discomfort and aggravation from not being able to bend my ankle or toes or to not be able to scratch an itch.</p><p>To help prepare my foot for some stimulation before walking again, while lying in bed on my back I would scoot down toward the tall, flat side of the wedge pillow and gently press the bottom of my foot onto it. This caused some mild pain especially on the bottom of the hammer toe. After a few nights of doing that, while lying in bed on my back with my knee bent up toward the ceiling, I placed my foot flat on the bed &amp; pressed my foot into the bed being careful to keep it steady &amp; flat to get used to some pressure. I also stretched my great toe as often as I could as instructed by the doctor when I had the cast removed.</p><p>When taking my first steps, I used crutches to only allow some of my weight on my foot at first...when it hurt I backed off &amp; tried later. I kept my weight on my heal area at first and the pains felt like pins &amp; needles, like sharp tingles similar to what it feels like when my foot has gone to sleep and is getting the feeling back, but sharper. It took me about four days from when they took the cast off and gave me the walking boot to get up the courage to put all my weight on my foot and take steps but the more I did it the faster it seemed to heal. I actually probably tried to do too much! My heal and ankle ached and burned some so I tried to keep my weight evenly distributed across the bottom of my foot. I did have some pain on the top of my foot &amp; toward my toes and had occasions of sharp shocking type pains that only lasted a second or two each time but mainly in the great toe.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to take any pain medication after the cast was removed, however I will say that wearing the walking boot was pretty uncomfortable so I didn\u2019t wear it when I was just sitting or lying around. It doesn\u2019t take much time being up and around on it for it to swell up, turn a purple color and ache somewhat. After about a week of being up and around on it my calf cramped a bit off and on probably because the muscles were being built back up.</p><p>[b]On April 3, 2018 [/b](7 weeks &amp; 4 days after surgery) I had another set of standing x-rays without the boot (hadn\u2019t stood without the boot up until this time and to my surprise&#160; I didn\u2019t experience much pain at all when I placed all my weight on my foot) and an exam. My surgeon was surprised I had so much movement in my great toe and said I was ahead of schedule with how well I was healing.&#160; I was told not to use the walking boot anymore and I could use the walking shoe that she gave me at this visit if I felt my ankle needed the support but that my tennis shoes would be fine. (I only used that walking shoe for about half that day and my tennis shoe for a few hours later that day. I just loosened up the strings to adapt for the swelling.)</p><p>Praise the Lord, I can walk! Still with a limp because of a stiff ankle but at least I don\u2019t have to wear that boot anymore! By the evening of April 3, I was walking with much less of a limp and even better about a week and a half after that. When I first stepped on my foot without the boot it felt as if the cold, hot, rough, etc. sensations were amplified on surfaces that I stood on.I had told my surgeon that my heal area was quite sore from walking in the boot and she said some plantar faciatis could be setting in but would get better with more movement/stretching.&#160; (The doctor also said she\u2019d scheduled me to have x-rays on my left foot for six months out and would request surgery scheduled for February of 2019 for my left foot.)</p><p>I could finally sleep without the wedge pillows at the foot of the bed with the covers touching my foot on Thursday, April 3.</p><p>[b]April 16, 2018 [/b](9 weeks &amp; 4 days after surgery) I&#39;m not limping much at all, my second toe is still pretty stiff and a little numb, almost all the feeling is back in my great toe. The top of my foot where the screws are is still a little sore when I put pressure on it with my hand and my ankle and heal get sore when I\u2019ve been up on my feet too long. My whole leg and foot still gets slightly purple and my foot still gets swollen but every day shows some improvement. I can walk bare footed but it gets too sore if I do it for longer than a few minutes. I wear thick rubberized \u201cbeach/shower\u201d type sandals/slippers around the house and if I go anywhere I wear Nu-Balance or Skechers tennis shoes. It is difficult rising from a squatted position as my toes are still somewhat stiff. It does seem like as soon as I started walking in the boot the faster it\u2019s been healing.</p><p>[b]April 21, 2018&#160;[/b] I\u2019m limping less but having more pains in different areas such as my instep and smaller toes. I suppose it could be because of the muscles getting back to normal use as opposed to when I limped more. I still need to rest, elevate and ice as it gets pretty sore, however, not as swollen as it did.</p><p>May 5, 2018 I\u2019m having less pains and the swelling has decreased but it still swells if I\u2019m on my foot too much throughout the day.&#160; The only area that gets a little purple now is just the foot and it doesn\u2019t get as dark as it used to.&#160; &#160;</p><p>[b]On May 15, 2018[/b] I had another set of x-rays and an exam. The doctor said my foot was doing excellent and that we could get the left foot operated on sooner if needed. I opted to wait until the same time next year that I had this foot done.</p><p>[b]May 30, 2018 [/b]I\u2019m walking without a limp at all except for when I\u2019ve been on my feet too much. I still have some numbness on the right side of my great toe and on the top of my second toe and down into the top of my foot just below my second toe. The incision scars are healing nicely but my toes still don\u2019t bend as well as my other foot. However, the doctor says I\u2019m doing excellent and ahead of schedule as far as how things are healing. I\u2019m wearing sturdy sandals most of the time and have a pair of Superfeet insoles for my tennis shoes.</p><p>[b]June 3, 2018 [/b]Went swimming and the sensation of the water on my great toe incision area as I was moving my foot against the water felt like my skin was loose and &quot;flapping&quot;. It was not painful, just a weird sensation. I&#39;m sure it was just nerves being stimulated.</p><p>[b]June 26, 2018[/b] I can now point my foot downward, getting full flexion while pointing toes. As the remaining numbness has been wearing off, there have been some pains here and there which is all still a part of the healing process.</p><p></p><p>Some concerns I had through this process was about weight gain. I lost weight for the first couple of weeks then gradually only gained about 8 lbs. from the day of surgery until now. I was also somewhat more emotional than I normally am. I was feeling fearful, helpless, uncertain, anxious, exhausted, sad, guilty, and burdensome, however, I just reminded myself that this is only temporary and there are people that are in way worse condition than I am in. Also, having to consider where we were able to go as far as needing to maneuver the scooter around or where to park the car when we needed to go out, etc. has made me more appreciative of the struggles of the handicapped than I was prior to surgery.</p><p></p><p>&#160;</p>"

          " <p>Unfortunately we&#39;re not Doctors on here, that&#39;s the best place for you to be. No public health care where you are?? </p><p>For what it&#39;s worth, it sounds muscular. However, when your back muscles spasm or become tense they tend to be protecting something else. That&#39;s why it needs investigated. </p> <p>Hello, You do need a diagnosis to be able to get the right treatment. I understand that you cannot afford to at the moment. In the meantime try some gentle stretching exercises. Only sit for short periods then walk a little. It&#39;s difficult to try and help without knowing the cause of your back pain. You may have a trapped nerve or slipped a disc. I have suffered a back problem for 20 years thou mine is Arthritis. I hope you soon get a diagnosis.&#160;</p> Try sleeping sitting up! I have AS and your issue sounds very much like AS! Look up the ankylosing spondylitis quiz and see if you pass or fail. <p>USA?</p><p></p><p>You may have slipped a disc or have a nerve compression....either way you are going to have to bite the bullet. We can give you support, we can explain blood work, disgnosis, share similar experience but we can not diagnose.</p><p></p><p>Aren&#39;t you required to carry insurance in the USA...don&#39;t you have to submit proof of health insurance with your fedetal tax return or am I thinking of a different country...</p> <p>As others have said we&#39;re not doctors but I get the same symptoms as you and I have slipped disk </p> <p>I&#39;m really sorry that you&#39;re having such terrible back problems. I&#39;ve been suffering from back problems for 10 years and I really hope that yours doesn&#39;t last long but I&#39;ve got to tell you it doesn&#39;t sound good to me. And with you not having insurance that&#39;s a bad thing. Fortunately right now insurance companies cannot turn you down like they could me when I hurt my back and didn&#39;t have insurance.</p><p></p><p>All that being said the only way you&#39;re going to help yourself is to get seen by a doctor. The reason why your massage didn&#39;t work is because when you have a back problem laying on your stomach aggravates the back. And as for sitting I can&#39;t sit either for more than about an hour and I use a cushion. Typically I just use the kind of cushion you can buy at Walmart that you would put on a kitchen chair those work just fine for me but you can spend a little extra money and buy these special pillows that have it cut out at the back so that your coxal does not rest on anything. That will help you&#39;re sitting problem.</p><p></p><p>Finally I would recommend you use either heat or ice. It really doesn&#39;t matter according to my physical therapist. It&#39;s whatever works for you. And take some kind of anti-inflammatory such as Motrin Advil Aleve any of those types of drugs will help with your back.</p><p></p><p>You might also get something called Biofreeze. It seems to be the go to with most therapist for rubbing into sore muscles. Personally I&#39;ve only had it used on me one time but that one time it felt really good. I don&#39;t believe you can buy it in stores. I think the only place to get it would be at physical therapist offices where they&#39;ll sell it to you or pain management doctor offices.</p><p></p><p>But everything I&#39;ve mentioned is nothing but a stopgap until you can see a doctor. You really do need to see a doctor though. Good luck with all of this and I hope for your sake that this is not a permanent problem for you.</p>"

          "<p>I&#39;m 20 years old and I&#39;m having SEVERE back pain. It&#39;s been going on for about 3 months. I don&#39;t have insurance so I can&#39;t see a doctor right now. Don&#39;t have the insurance or money to do so. It started waking up one morning and it wasn&#39;t as severe. I didn&#39;t fall or do anything out of the ordinary that I think would do anything to my back. It&#39;s mostly in the middle of my back. and wraps around my back rib cage. Now, it has spread to my lumbar/lower back and into both sides of my hips. I&#39;ve literally tried everything. I&#39;ve changed the way I&#39;ve slept (pillow between legs, flipped mattess, sleeping with one pillow instead of two), taking ibuprofen, stretching, exercise, massage, icyhot. Nothing has helped. It starts during the night and when I wake up i can barely move my back. Taking a deep breath HURTS. Feels like there is a ton of tension in my back. I haven&#39;t gone to the chiropractor bcz thinking of anyone doing anything to my back makes me hurt. The massage made me feel even more worse the next day. I can&#39;t sit for long either bcz my tailbone starts hurting. Like I&#39;ve bruised it or something but my back pain was first then a month or two after the tailbone pain started happening. Once I get off of it for sitting down it feels numb like a warm tingly sensation. The pain used to stop after about 15 minutes of being out of the bed from waking up and moving around and it was fine. Now my back pain radiates throughout the day. I need help! Anything would help! I&#39;m feel hopeless against this pain. Please help..</p>"

          " Oh and to add insult to injury I received a response to my letter of complaint and had to go to the Post Office with \u00a31.24 to pay to unpaid postage before having the pleasure of reading their standard reponse of the Trust has 25 WORKING days to respond to my letter!!! hi jenie dont understand what all that was about but , sounds like your in the same situ as most of us. gail [quote:25adb98977=\\\"gail\\\"]hi jenie dont understand what all that was about ,,,[/quote:25adb98977] It was a terrible disc prolapse story,, I didnt see anything too inflamatory so I dunno why its moderated :) All I temporarily removed the post so that we can read through it properly and for no other reason. We recently were asked by Darren to remove some of his posts - so we are just being careful for you. As you can see, I have now the post back Lin Patient Admin hi jenie what a heart breaking tale of the nhs system, which i myself the same as you have been left since oct 21 2005 with significant prolapses and compression with displacement of the spinal cord at c5-6 and c6-7 and been passed from piller to post this doctor and that, i like you are on the verge of losing my job as i have been on sick leave since feb(i love my job and the financal gain from it)but un like you havent been given a date well strictly speaking i have several and every one of them false and now ive been told around christmas i really do not know where to turn ive involved some influentail people but as we can see the hospitals broken no rules as the waiting time is marked from when i was placed on the surgeons list, and not when i was told by a ortho doc that couldnt do the op that i needed surgery, which was back in feb(it took the system 18 mths to diagnose me!!!!) as i understand if you,d been offered a admission date and you couldnt attend then you should have been offered another at a max of 28 days later?? maybe you should query this. gail Hi Jenie, I have just read your story and you have my deepest sympathy. So much that I can relate to. But do you know what, you have done yourself a huge favour because you have clearly recorded everything including all the dates. Have you put in a formal complaint to the hospital? Is it an English hospital? Sorry, but my geography is awful :) :) There are all sorts of NHS time limits that come into play here. And you need to fight them using their own regulations as your weapon of choice. As you have found out, emotion gets you nowhere. Clearly you have been shunted from pillar to post, and days become weeks, become months.... In the meantime you are not getting any better. Watch the numbness. Like you I started out in a lot of pain, but as more and more numbness set in I became more worried. My operation is in 10 days, but I don't think it is going to do much for the numbness. That makes me really angry, because if they had got their finger out and done what they should have done sooner then maybe my prognosis would be better. Work is always a difficult issue, and I really hope that your employer gets behind you to support you in this. Most of my sick leave this year has been unpaid or else I've had to use up my annual leave, but hey, with surgery hanging over my head since May I haven't been able to go anywhere anyway!!!! Does your GP support you? There are some good people here, with lots of good advice, but most importantly of all, you'll find out that you are not the only one that this is happening to. Trying to get proper help from the NHS when they get it wrong time and time again is such a lonely road. Good luck TFU Thanks to Dr. Spock, Gail and TFU. I have found this site really informative and it is good to hear from other people who are in the big NHS maze of distress just like me, as I don't know anyone personally who is going through this and I am tired of being pitied, felt sorry for or just blantly treated like a cripple who needs charity. Each night when I give up on sleeping I look through the posts and you have all inspired me not to give up! I am covered by the Stockport NHS Pennine Trust. In respect of my GP all I seem to get is \\&quot;oh well\\&quot;, \\&quot;you know I really can't do anything further to help you, but here are some even stronger painkillers to turn you into a dribbling wreck\\&quot;. My GP has tried her best I suppose with the tools that she has available and she hit the roof when I went back to work, but with a child and heavy committments I don't have much choice. Both my Consultant and GP are aware of my saddle numbness and the fact that I do not have any feeling on the odd time that I have had intercourse. My employer is dragging me over the coals, I have a capability hearing in two weeks time, they have refused to be flexible so to allow me to work, I have an office based job which involves a lot of finance and funding applications, so getting frequent breaks is difficult, because when your doing a job you love time flies by. I did negotiate reduced hours by using my annual leave to cover the shortfall, but as they refused to do a work station assessment until 18 November even though our occupation health unit requested it in October 06, the recent assessment flagged my desk as being inadequate and that they have failed to provide me with an appropriate chair, unfortunately though I have ended up with my lastest episode (as my GP calls it). I spoke to a chiropractor today and I am going to see him on Monday, he feels that surgery could have been avoided if I would have been assessed correctly. As my condition is starting to deteriorate I thought that by seeing the chiropractor then this may bide me some time. He was also concerned about the saddle numbness. I am off to see my local Councillors tomorrow in response to a recent article by one of them that states \\&quot;the NHS has never been so good\\&quot; armed with all the documentation I have received, and the large box of medication that I have accumilated. I am also preparing a letter to go to our caring Primeminister and will keep sending it until I get a reply. I have lodge a formal complaint with the Chief Exec of the Trust, but my only reponse so far has been a general letter that I had to collect from the Post Office because they had not paid the postage and it cost me \u00a31.24 to find out that they have 25 working days to response to my complaint! I know it may not mean nothing but I am really sorry for all of you that are suffering as a result of the NHS shortfalls and if I could take your pain away I would. I am just thankful that my condition is treatable and that my daughter will not loose her mother. I never realised that by having a bad back my whole life would be turned upsidedown. Unlike my Nanny I will have plenty of years ahead of me, so I keep thinking of the future and that this is a temporary set back! Jenie :steam: hi jenie i admire your determination, not to be a wet blanket but i have tried just about all the things you have or about to and its got me no-where, when i complained to the hospital c/exec via my am i got a reply apoligising for being mislead and told we cannot give an actual date as yet but your surgery will be around christmas, that was it! i,ve complained to so many depts im sick of the whole thing you get nothing but apologys and nothing else.my gp has been very good and has wrote again asking that my surgery be brought forward and she can do no more, but as you state what we have is not life threatening(terribly painful and debilitating though) and we will eventually get through it. hopefully for those who are now being diagnosed then the new waiting times being set up will help them. but in the mean time we have to suffer and continue to cost the country money via incapacity and other benefits, that we would not have needed if the treatment was available earlier. just doesnt make sense????take care gail Hi Jenie, Anger is your friend. You have every right to be angry, these people have failed you miserably, don't let them forget it. Wait to see what the first response is to your complaint. But don't expect much. You will need to be very well versed in NHS rules and regulations, because they will use those to support their position and will not admit where they have fallen short unless you point out what NHS rules and regulations they have broken. If you haven't already done so, I would suggest you start your research in good time so you can hit them with it when you get their first response. Try googling 'NHS time limits' 'NHS reasonable dates' 'NHS complaints procedures'. I always found the articles/targets prepared by individual NHS Trusts most useful. Do not threaten any legal action because as soon as you do, you move into a whole different league of trouble. If they get just a whiff of you planning that then your complaint ends, as will your care. At this stage you don't want to be left with just that avenue, because the reality is that it is very expensive and will get you nowhere. You have three years to commence legal proceedings, so you don't have to do anything for a good while yet. The case would in any case hinge on the clinical harm that you have suffered as a result of the delays. E.g if you ended up with a full blown Cauda Equina Syndrome crisis because they left operating too long. The truth is that until you get your op and can monitor your recovery, you won't know how you have been harmed by the delays. You may make a complete recovery, you may not, but if you don't and it is clear that your prognosis would have been better had you received surgery quicker, then at that point you will need to decide what to do. As my complaint has rumbled on I have found all sorts of ways they have broken their own rules. But of course all of this needs to run alongside what is really important which is you getting the care you need now. The best advice I can give you, is the advice a Canadian friend gave me. \\&quot;Be a squeaky wheel\\&quot;. One word of warning though, if you turn down an offer of care, then they may try to use that against you. I understand why you want to defer treatment for now, but just be careful. Again check out what you can about 'Reasonable Dates' and 'Deferments'. Research, research, research is the key. It will be interesting to see what your talk to the local councillors and your letter to the PM bring forth? What about your local MP? Keep us posted, TFU Hi Jennie, I totally sympathise with you, something should be done about the length of time we are all kept waiting. I am 40 and I've had back problems for 22 years but I hurt my back in Dec last year and spent New Years Eve in Hospital. Had a Sacral Epidural Injection done no improvement at all. Readmitted 15th Jan had Discectomy on 19th this also made no difference. Had another Sacral Epidual Injection and Nerve Root Block in May this year. Went to see my Consultant 9.11.07 for the 9th time this year and I'm now waiting for another operation Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion. But true to NHS Form there is a 4-5 month waiting list and this apparently is the Urgent List. I have not worked at all this year I am divorced with 2 teenagers, I have a good family who help me. But it's a struggle to live on \u00a372 Incapacity Benefit. I'm still in constant pain and my left leg and foot are totally numb. I take 8 Tramadol, 1 Lansoprazole, 1 Amitryptin, 1 Fluoxetine, 2 Indometacin Tablets a day and I have Morphine Patches that I change weekly. When my kids go out to school/college I'll sit and have a coffee this is about 8.30am I fall into a deep comatozed sleep and my kids wake me up again at 4.00pm when they come back in. This is know life! We have to keep going on as the only thing keeping me going is the thought that I will hopefully within a couple of months be pain free. Take care, Angela Thank you for all of your comments they have been very useful and have spurned me on further. The meeting with the Councillors went well, but I don't think that they can do much. They were appalled at my story and have agreed to write to the Trust, but they say that they do not have leverence with the Trust, but they can certainly fire off a number of letters on my behalf, they have suggested getting in touch with the local media to see if the coverage would force their hand. However, I am not so sure! I saw the chiropractor today and I feel like crying, he feels that if they had diagnosed me correctly then I could have been fixed without surgery. He is going to write to my consultant to agree some interim care and the good news is that I have developed some sensation in my left leg, and we talked at length about my condition, so now I feel more empowered. My GP had insisted on my going swimming a couple of times a week, and this I have been told today is not a good idea and if I want to exercise then I should carry on going for walks. He was concerned about the fact that I had displayed equina symptoms, (constant saddle numbness, loss of feeling in my leg and foot, loss of sexual sensation, the fact that my legs just give way when I am walking), and they had not acted. Well, I made a decision that I am to come off the meds as I need to be able to look after my 8 year old and want to stay focused. Why is it when I ask for help I just get stronger painkillers, do they think if I am semi-comatose on medication, I won't notice what is going on? When I can manage to sit long enough my next plan of action is to do as TFU has suggested and research, research, research! Knowledge is power! Take care everyone. Jenie Hi Jenie I too had a wonderful Chiropractor and I would definately trust her advice the most. I too was told to walk, but preferably not on stairs, on the flat. I thought I had been soooo clever and everyday at work walked from the fifth floor to the ground floor, 105 steps in all, and I did this in laps twice a day for about 8 circuits. I'd walk down but then get the lift up and walk down again. But apparently this was the worse thing I could do! I find though that walking uphill hurts my foot more, I think because of the angle on the ground. As part of what has happened with my discs I ended up with a misaligned pelvis and one leg longer than the other. My posture is dreadful as well and this has affected my hip. No doubt all these things will need to be sorted out again in due course. The chiropractor put my leg back several times and straightened up my pelvis but they wouldn't stay put because of the underlying disc problem. It's good you have got some feeling back in your leg, is it back to normal though or just replaced with pain? I can relate to the Cauda Equina Syndrome symptoms, I have the same as you apart from the constant saddle numbness. I had that for a few days back in May but it went. I have had a bit of incontinence (both types lol) but I ignore that and it hasn't happened often. For me a CES crisis is my biggest worry. Can I ask with your foot...what is going on with your toes? Four of mine hurt all the time and no medication seems to stop that. It is as though the meds can't quite get to that part. And my toes are permanently scrunched up and sort of locked now. My big toe isn't the same as the others, in that it doesn't hurt but if I move it the sensation is really really weird. Not pain though. To me the movement is to be avoided at all costs, a bit like nails down a blackboard, it isn't the act in itself which is the problem, just the effect. It makes me feel physically sick. I read somewhere that the further south the pain/numbness problem the greater the compression. Good luck coming off the meds. But be careful, there will probably be side effects to the withdrawal. I hate the meds but can't imagine how I would battle on without them. Keep us posted... TFU I too have developed problems with my right knee and hip, as well as the feeling of one leg being longer than the other, which is true apparently, due to posture changes to compensate for the changes caused by the prolapse. I thought I was going mad! Well, I received a telephone call today offering me a surgery date for 4 December, not sure how this has come about because they were supposed to booked up until February!!! But now I am starting to have doubts, I have been misdiagnosed twice and given two remedial actions by the Consultant, how can I trust them to get it right? The Chiropractor I saw said he would like a month with me to go through treatment to see if I respond, and the fact that I have developed some feeling in my leg has made me think, the saddlenumbness has settled from constant to flare ups. I have not suffered from incontinence as such (barr peeing when I sneeze). My toes felt like they were cramping and I had to buy bigger shoes to avoid aggrevating it, my foot though feels like a dead weight sometimes and the pins &amp; neddles drives me nuts. Coming off my meds was a good idea at the time, but nobody warned me about the withdrawal, I thought I was dying over the weekend, I feel sick, dizzy, even more fatigued and very very emotional. The pain has kicked in big time, but I keep thinking if I learn to live with it at its worst then I can take anything else, I just want to curl up into a ball and hide under my duvet, but I keep telling myself that it can only get better! After all this battling I am so confused, I really don't want them to touch me, I keep getting the awful feeling that I got that cold back in October for a reason and I should not have the operation. How can I trust them? I have really had enough of it all, any suggestions? Jenie Oh Jenie, I think you and I must be soul mates!! If you have been reading my posts generally you will see that I am really struggling with the whole trust issue too. Back in May I'd have absolutely leapt at the chance of an operation, crawled a mile over broken glass to get to it....but now, so much has happened, the whole hospital experience has gone so horribly wrong and like you I don't know what to do. I do know that I don't want to be like this any more. That is a good starting point. We are all products of our experiences and as a result of that I have no faith in the hospital, the staff and particularly the surgeon. And the statistics I've found on the internet don't help either, regarding likely prognosis, based on age, being female, length of time since symptoms first appeared etc. Do I want them to touch me, bearing in mind they have got everything wrong so far? No. Will I let them touch me? Right now I have no idea. I'm not surprised you got offered a surgery date in early December. As I have said previously, I think the NHS is having a bit of a clear out of the old cases ready for the new 'dry runs' for the 18 weeks to treatment legislation that is effective from the end of next year. That, plus people not wanting the December dates because of an operation ruining Christmas. I guess for most people who have waited absolutely ages, waiting another few weeks until January isn't going to hurt. I'm not surprised you had problems coming off the meds. I did too. In fact I lasted 27 hours. The scary thing s that we now need those just to feel anything even vaguely resembling normal! Only you can decide what to do about accepting the surgery date. When do you have to let them know by? For what it's worth, because they didn't give you three weeks notice in writing it isn't a 'reasonable date' unless you have already accepted verbally in which case it is. Best wishes TFU hi all i think everyone is having doubts because of being left so long, and of course sometimes these disc problems do heal (albeit over a long time) i too was reconsidering back in jan this year i had hardley any pain , and thought ok its healed itself, but in feb it came back with a vengance (no idea why) and has been with me ever since ok some days are better than others but on the whole there is no way i could continue to live like this. only you can decide if surgery is for you, it is a tough decition to make, maybe make a list of the pros and cons see if that would help. i phoned the hospital yesterday to see if im on the computer for an admission date yet and was told there is nothing down for me but they give 2 wks notice , so im realy hoping to be in before xmas i dont even care if its the weekend before, ive already had two ruined christmases having to endure the pain so another wont make much difference!. good luck to you both .gail"

          "I am 33 years old and here is my story to date, as per a complaint that I have registered with my local Pennine NHS Trust. To give a brief history on Monday 14 August 2006 I collapsed at home with severe groin pain. I attended my GP who requested a blood sample and I was told to rest, if symptoms were to increase then I was to go to A&amp;E. On Tuesday 15 August I received a telephone call from my GP stating that my white cell count was raised and that I was to report directly to a ward at Stepping Hill as I has a suspected appendicitis. After being admitted to the ward I underwent a series of blood tests, scans and x-rays. Other than confirming that I did not have an appendicitis no condition was diagnosed even though I was suffering from excruciating pain, I was given painkillers and told to go back to see my GP. I was prescribed Arcoxia 120mg and Metronidazole 400mg for the sickness. After this I was prescribed Co-codamol 30/500mg and Ibuprofen 400mg with Lansoprazole to protect my stomach and Lactulose to combat the constipation. Again assumptions were made about my condition and my GP requested an investigation into whether I had developed Endometriosis again, so on Monday 23 October 2006 I was admitted to the surgical unit for a laparoscopy, which did not show any changes to substaniate this diagnosis. After the laparoscopy I was left with a very nasty infection that took five doses of antibiotics to clear, the two stitches that we used to close the wound came undone the day after and I was left with green puss leaking from it. The doctor that performed the laparoscopy suggested that I have my coil checked and that the pain could be a result of my back. On 1 November 2006 my GP checked my coil and took a swab of the area surrounding it. The results were negative for infection. I returned to work on 4 December 2006 only to go back on sick leave 8 January 2007. On 24 January 2007 I attended physio therapy and was assessed and given ten exercises to do in repetitions of ten to be done four times a day. When I queried the Physio Therapist as to why I have been referred to physio without first having a scan, I was told that I couldn't expect a third intervention, as the first intervention were the investigations into the appendicitis, the second intervention being the laparoscopy. However, on 12 February I was unable to get out of bed, even after taking two co-codamol and two ibuprofen, and I was left with mobility problems that lasted for over a week. On attending the last physio appointment, I was informed that I needed an urgent MRI scan to identify the problem and that I was not to continue with the exercises. In February 2007 I was prescribed Diclofenac 50mg, but these were not effective so I was told to continue with the co-codamol and ibuprofen. On 28 February 2007 I attended an appointment with a senior Physio Therapist and she told me that in her opinion there was nothing seriously wrong with my back, but I should keep the MRI scan appointment to be on the safe side and to complete some minor exercises. On 5 March 2007 I underwent an MRI scan at Withington Community Hospital and had further blood tests taken on 3 April 2007. The results of the MRI scan were that I have prolapsed disc and enlarged lymph nodes in my groin. I attended an appointment on 10 May with a Consultant at the Trauma &amp; Orthopaedic Clinic and the first thing out of his mouth was that I needed surgery to remove the prolapsed disc. On 15 May I attended an appointment at the General Medicine Clinic, only to be told that it was the heart clinic and that I had been wrongly referred! I had a smear test on 18 June 2007, this was negative. On 26 June 2007 I gave up smoking in anticipation of the operation. On 6 July my GP prescribed DF118 Dihydrocodeine 40mg and senna to relieve the constipation. I attended an appointment with a Consultant at the pain clinic and he told me that the waiting list for the injection was longer than the operation waiting list. He said that the injection could possibly reduce the symptoms but this could not be guaranteed. On 26 July 2007 I attended an appointment with the Occupational Health Unit at my work place and we agreed a phased return to work commencing on 23 August 2007. My pre-op assessment was on 16 August and the Consultant informed my that it could be possible to shave the offending part of the disc, instead of removing it. However, I received a telephone call to say that they had not taken enough blood samples and that I had to attend again to have more blood taken, which I did on 13 September 2007. The surgery was scheduled for Monday 8 October and admission would be on Sunday 7 October. On Thursday 4 October I telephoned the surgical ward to arrange an admission time and to inform them that I had developed a cold. I was told that I should be okay to proceed with the operation as colds only last a few days and that I was to telephone the ward on Sunday to obtain an admission time. On Sunday 7 October 2007 I telephoned the ward as agreed and was told that I could not be admitted due to the cold, I was told to contact the waiting list office on Monday morning to organise a new date. I telephoned the waiting list office on Monday 8 October and explained what had happened and the person was very cold and unsympathetic, she basically told me that it was all my fault and that they were now booked up until February, oh but there is an opening a few days before Christmas. She also had a go at me for wasting surgery time and stated that I have only been waiting since July, in which I replied that this has been ongoing since August 2006. By the end of the telephone call I was reduced to tears and was left feeling very depressed. My mother contacted the waiting list office on Wednesday 10 October to try and see if there was anything that could be done to expedite the matter, however, the person was rude, sarcastic and uncooperative, when my mum explained that she had given up her job to look after both me and my daughter, the person told her that she's better get back to work then, shouldn't she and how is my pain her fault, and what does my mum expect her to do. I telephoned the waiting list office again on Friday 12 October to try and discuss the situation as I had a management review meeting at work that morning. I explained that as a single mother I cannot take an appointment too close to Christmas as this would ruin my 8 year old daughters Christmas and that this could my terminally ill Nannies last Christmas. I also explained that I did not miss my operation date through any fault of my own, that I was acting on the guidance of the ward in respect of the cold and had I known I would have contacted the waiting list office on the Thursday to reschedule. I was told that there are no foreseeable surgery dates, I asked to be considered for a cancellation, as all arrangements are in place for me to be admitted and that I live close by. On 19 October 2007 I went on sick leave again and have been signed off work since. I attended a GP appointment on 26 October and have been prescribed the following medication; DHC Continus 120mg tablets, Movicol 13.8g Oral Powder Sachets (laxative to combat the constipation caused by DNC Continus), Fentanyl 25micrograms/hour patches, Metoclopramide 10mg tablets (anti-sickness to combat the Fentanyl), Naproxen 250mg tablets and Omeprazole 20mg capsules (gastric protection from Naproxen). I am also taking Mirtazapine 45mg for clinical depression. I contacted the waiting list office again on Monday 5 November 2007 and was told that the Consultant had scheduled additional dates, again I was offered a date close to Christmas namely 21 December. I find this very beculiar as this is the same date that I was offered nearly a month ago, and yet there have been no cancellations? It has been nearly seventeen months since I became symptomatic and yet I have been wrongly diagnosed, had an unnecessary surgical procedure. I am on the verge of loosing my job as my team cannot assimilate my work load and my sick pay is coming to an end. It seems that the longer this goes on the more damage I am sustaining to my back, I have started to develop numbness in my right foot now, constant saddle numbness and problems passing urine. My knee joints and right hip joint have also decided to join the party and my legs love to give up while walking so I end up as a heap on the pavement with no good samaritans running to my aid. I really need to get back to work to support my child and I can no longer keep depending on my mother to assist me as she is 62 years old, has high blood pressure, asthma and diabetes. So my predicament is that my work has just issued capability proceedings against me, which is in two weeks time, so come Christmas there will be no santa. GOD BLESS OUR WONDERFUL NHS! :x"

          " Welcome to the forum. I've only been here since July but, like you, have found the comments of others to be most helpful. I cannot say whether all of the symptoms you're experiencing are related to CS. But the neck and lower back pain are very familiar to me. I also found that Amitriptilene didn't help. I would like to offer you some constructive advice but would ask some questions first. You say that you had controllable pains over Christmas but you were in agony as soon as you went back to work. What did you do differently over Christmas compared to a work day? Were you more active or less active? You also ask why the condition is worse when seated. Does the condition worsen immediately you sit down or after you have been seated for some time? I find having a bath can make me feel better, at least temporarily. But it never makes me feel worse although I do have problems holding the shower attachment to wash my hair. Do you find that holding or reaching for items is a problem (e.g. soap, shampoo)? Do you have similar trouble holding, say, a pen or a telephone for more than a few minutes? Sorry to be so nosey. But, hopefully, I may be able to help you in some way. Please don't hesitate to send me a private message if you'd rather not post a reply here. Look forward to hearing from you. Thanks for your reply, I didn't really go to deep into my discomforts and pains because my discussion was so long and I didn't want to bore everyone to death. I seem to be lucky compared to a lot of other sufferers on this site in the way that, if I am lying down i.e in bed or on the floor I do not get any pains at all. I wake every morning and it is as if there was nothing wrong at all, however, sometime within 30 minutes to 3 hours later my neck pain will be back. My symptoms have varied all year long but have now seemed to become more predictable. At the moment my mother is ill in hospital after suffering a massive stroke and over Xmas and today I have spent many hours stood up at her bedside and although my neck pains and chest pains are apparent, they are bearable and after a few wiggles and stretches I can keep them at bay. However, as soon as I sit down in the car to drive the 1 hour journey home they come back with a vengance. Today it started with a slight stabbing/muscle pull or tear feeling in my stomach followed by the pains in my neck just above the shoulder line. With reference to what I do diferently at work to home, the answer is sitting down in a chair in front of my PC, at home I can lounge across the sofa and get a comfortable position, at work I sit at the PC in the \\&quot;correct\\&quot; posture and my neck starts to hurt. On Mondays the pain will gradually start and worsen through the day and by Thursday I am usually totally uncomfortable from the minute I get to work and this pain will stay all night until I lay down again. With reference to the bath, the pains will be there whilst sitting in the bath but when I get out I start to feel unwell, something similar to when you have a bath which is too hot, i.e Light headed and nauseous. This feeling is there if I have a long hot soak, a short soak or a quick splash in a cool bath, so it is nothing to with the water heat. I ride my cycle to work and have a shower every morning at work and have no such feelings, in fact hot or cold on my neck brings instant relief for the time that they are in contact, the pain returns shortly after removal. I get no apparent loss of strength or pains in my arms when lifting unless I am carrying shopping for a period of time and then it is only minor. I usually suffer for 1 or 2 days after a shopping spree but not during. The only discomfort during shopping is in my lower back and in my wallet!!! I had the oppotunity in August last year to do a manual (as opposed to administrative) job with the company for a four week period. I had no problems lifting heavy stuff around and standing on my feet all day, in fact my neck was bearable for most of the time, when I returned to my normal job in front of the PC, I soon reverted to my neck pains. My main concern during the 4 weeks manual work was a general feeling of being \\&quot;unwell\\&quot; (as previously described) in the evenings. As an added \\&quot;cause\\&quot;, I spent 23 years in the armed forces as a mechanic with not a single ailment, I now spend 8/9 hours a day in front of a PC. I read your reply to my message with great interest as there are some similarities with my experience. The greatest similarity is that your symptoms worsen the more you do; for instance, you say that, at work on Monday, the pain will start gradually and worsen during the day but, by Thursday, the discomfort is virtually instant (and, perhaps, stronger). It strikes me that your symptoms appear when you\u2019re using your hands, arms or neck, perhaps more so when you\u2019re grasping something such as a steering wheel, computer mouse or even a towel to dry yourself after a bath or shower. At work, presumably you\u2019re using a computer keyboard and mouse for most of the day. Therefore, you\u2019re constantly moving your hands and arms. Probably without realising it, you\u2019re also moving your neck a great deal to look at items on the desk in front of you, to look up at people elsewhere in the room, etc. The more you do this over the course of the week, the worse you feel. Over Christmas, you weren\u2019t really doing this to the same extent so, consequently, you felt somewhat easier. When driving back from the hospital, you\u2019re gripping the steering wheel and changing gears and continually moving your head to keep an eye on other motorists. When you say that the neck pain starts sometime within 30 minutes to 3 hours after getting up, does the onset of the pain tend to occur more quickly later in the week? It may be 3 hours on Monday but only 30 minutes by Friday. If so, that suggests to me that your activities at work (and, perhaps, getting to/from work) are aggravating the condition as the week progresses. I too can find great comfort in a bath but burning sensations appear afterwards when drying myself, dressing and making something to eat. Your description here of feeling lightheaded sounds uncannily familiar as does your shopping experience: an increasing burning sensation in the lower back (at the base of the spine) which hangs around for some time afterwards. In my case, the burning sensations are also present when I wake up and can make it difficult to get out of bed. To an extent, I\u2019ve learned to adapt to the condition but it can still surprise me. As you\u2019ve probably worked out from reading this forum, there is no quick fix solution. The only advice I can give you is to adapt your daily life to suit the condition which I realise (and know, from bitter experience) is easier said than done. Finally, does your employer know what you\u2019re experiencing? It may sound like a drastic step but, if you worked fewer hours, that may improve matters although it would probably damage your bank balance. Anyhow, if you want to talk more about it, don\u2019t hesitate to write. I\u2019ll keep an eye open for future messages on this board from you or send me a private message, if you prefer. In the meantime, look after yourself. hi, everyone, after all the time i have been on here i havent heard a sufferer discuss something so near to my own problems. i didnt realise that lower back pain was anything to do with my cs. i assumed it was another version of it such as as. the feeling when you come out of the bath is very similar to my experience when i come out of the shower, i thought that letting warm water run onto my neck would help, but i experience such fogginess and extra pain i dont know what to do with myself. my lower back pain is such that it is there when i wake up and it really hurts to move, if i sit for any length of time i cant stand up and feel really foolish, which i know isnt my fault but , what can you do, i am waiting yet again to be referred to see another consultant, i guess i will be fobbed off yet again. thanks for your insights, it was good to know what i am going through isnt unique. hi all, i oftem read this site and today i decided to write something.i was diagnosed with cs two years ago. im 46 and last year was my worst for pain.its there daily now and in a lot of different places. head,shoulders,lower back. my doctor says it gets worse and ive got to live with it. it got bad very quickley! my mother got it at 46 and was told she couldnt work any more. im going back to doctor and hopefully this time he will refer me . im sure it will show up on xray that my bones have worsened? i often feel sick and light headed especially when walking or sitting with my head down. has anyone else been told they cant work with cs? im ready to throw towel in. its lovely to read all your letters. it helps to know someone else understands. thanks for listening and lets keep smiling [quote:002dcb40ea=\\\"leocat\\\"]hi all, i oftem read this site and today i decided to write something.i was diagnosed with cs two years ago. im 46 and last year was my worst for pain.its there daily now and in a lot of different places. head,shoulders,lower back. my doctor says it gets worse and ive got to live with it. it got bad very quickley! my mother got it at 46 and was told she couldnt work any more. im going back to doctor and hopefully this time he will refer me . im sure it will show up on xray that my bones have worsened? i often feel sick and light headed especially when walking or sitting with my head down. has anyone else been told they cant work with cs? im ready to throw towel in. its lovely to read all your letters. it helps to know someone else understands. thanks for listening and lets keep smiling[/quote:002dcb40ea] Hiya Leocat :) Would just like to empathize with you, re the pain all over, as cs is basically degenerative osteoarthritis I would hazard a guess that the little beastie gets fed up in one place and likes to make it's self known elsewhwere, Grrrrrr, it isn't nice at all and very frustrating!! Please ask your gp to refer you to a rheumatologist who should get some MRI scans done etc, do you have anyprivate medical insurance? This would be useful for getting a private referral. If not the cost is about \u00a3150 for a consultation. I have been unable to work for about 15 years with lumbar spondylosis and prolapsed discs due to and injury whilst working, however there is no way I could work with CS. Hope this helps take care, be gentle with yourself and keep smiling :) Emxx :wink: Aunty Em, I agree with you that the little beastie gets fed up in one place and finds somewhere else to go. At the moment, my left knee is complaining like mad. Although this is not a totally new symptom, it's not that common and is joining forces with the usual burning sensations which I experience in my neck, lower back and upper right arm. I am due to go to hospital tomorrow for a cervical epidural but the weather here in suburban Hertfordshire is truly atrocious today. It looks as if I may have to cancel the appointment. Leocat, make sure you get referred to someone who can help you more. I know from bitter experience that doctors can be slow to act but you should insist on having a MRI scan, preferably of your whole body, even if you have to make a nuisance of yourself. Your symptoms sound incredibly similar to my own and an MRI scan of my neck last year showed severe degeneration. However, I am meeting resistance to having a scan of my lower back where I have been suffering intermittent pain since at least the early 1970s. As for work, I cannot imagine what I could do as any sustained activity is, literally, a pain the neck. Unfortunately, we're all pretty much in the same boat. My best wishes to you, Leocat, and please stay in touch with us on this forum. I would be genuinely interested to know how you get on. I started with neck and arm pain in my early twenties. Went to the doctor who told me I was \\&quot;far too young for reumatism\\&quot;. I am now 52 and have suffered constantly - despite several referrals to my local hospital were the \\&quot;specialist \\&quot; has just fobbed me off. I have spent thousands of pounds on private treatments over the years which releaves the problem for a while but then it comes back. Treatment for long term pain in the UK is appalling and when you keep returning to the GP you get treated as if you are some sort of depressive moron. I no longer go to my GP but just live off painkillers and supplements I am quite sure that if I was some famous footballler or sports personality or royalty my problem would have been dealt with correctly years ago. I have found though that taking both amino acids, fish oils and Glucosamine helps though they need to be taken togather. I have tried just one on its own but neck pain come back. It is expensive to take all three but it does help. Hello my fellow sufferers of CS - I feel sorry for us all, because people dont seem to understand our condition including some doctors- i've been a sufferer for eight years now and when I first started to get the symptoms - I thought that I was dying!! It took years before I was finally diagnosed as having CS and that was after numerous visits to the hospitals to see various experts and finally after having two MIR scans the condition was diagnosed. I've now been told by my doctore that I have severe spondylosis. My symptoms are: Pain at the back of the head - pain down my right side of my neck - pain in both of my shoulders - pain in both my arms - pain in my middle back - and I used to have pain across my chest but thats gone now. I also have a myclonic condition [ muscle spasms] other symptoms that people may not know about - that I get , are dizzy spells - ringing in my ears - I also have muscle weakness in both my arms and numbness in my hands and sometimes my arms. The only pain killer that I found to have any benefit is TRAMADOL but pain killers will only work if i'm resting, as soon as I'm mobile the pain will generate all through my body. I worked as long as I was able - but it became all too much for me - so I had to apply for incapacity benefit - which I received long term. I'm now applying for disability benefit - but Ive found this process to be flawed - biased and very unfair - the decision makers only take notice of their provided doctors - little notice is taken of your own GP - and there are questions in the medicals that are set as traps to try and catch out the customers [ as they call us] one such question is: can you walk to the shops for 10 minutes - if you're answer is yes, then you would stand no hope of getting disabiliy mobility allowance - you wont get this benefit even it the doctor says that in his opinion \\&quot;you're only able to walk 200 metres slowly and with a few brief halts\\&quot; It appears to me that the DWP dont take sufferers of CS very seriously. I'm at the moment waiting for a tribunal - I believe that there is a way of getting these benefits that they keep telling us that were not claiming - if you want to know what you should be putting down on your claims form to the DWP : just reply and I'll tell you.because there is one question that will have them beat. if anybody is interested in the procedure of applying for incapacity benefit or Disability benefit and want some help - please respond to this - and i'lll gladly be happy to tell you. it's about time we fought for our rights. I have recently been diagnose with CS and will be seeing a consultant for the first time on Saturday. I have in the last few weeks been feeling really quite ok that is until this weekend when my neck started to hurt and my left shoulder has become painful and swollen again. Today however I have pain in so many places, including my ribs, lower back, head and my elbow joints are very swollen and I feel ill, light headed and dizzy. I feel so bad I am wondering if I have a virus that is attacking all the weak areas in my body, or is this in fact due to the CS? If that is the case why are all these things happening because of a problem in my neck? I really need some help please to try and make sense of all of this and also when I do see my consultant on Saturday I am better informed. Thanks in anticipation. Unfortunately, Little Bear, the nature of CS is that you have a bewildering array of symptoms, any or none of which can be present at any given time. You will have periods when you feel relatively OK and other times when you wonder what on earth is happening to you. The lightheaded feeling and dizziness are familiar to me too. Let me know how you get on with the specialist on Saturday. Hopefully, he/she will send you for an MRI scan but you may well be referred to a physiotherapist or even be put on a course of painkillers. HI everyone iam going through a bad time at the moment i was interested to hear peoples descriptions of what is similar to mine, i workout 4 days per week and have done so this last 25 yrs, my symptoms resemble what i have read on here!i SYMPTOMS are: chest pain on activity also neck pain, what happens is my sternum will start to ache as well has my neck, the pain is scary, also i feel lightheaded! and a slight feeling of nausea, followed by an headache, i have also noticed my neck grinds when i turn it, movement seems restricted. this is alot worse at the gym \\&quot;after exercise\\&quot; i have been to AE dozens of times thinking iam about to have an heart attack all seems normal oh yes i have noticed that when i lean forward sitting! is that my left arm aches and my fingers go numb, then if i stand and place my arm behind my back all returns to mormal. i hVE a feeling its to do with my neck. although docs havent looked into my neck. they have mentioned i may have costochondritus \\&quot; imflamation of the sternum. after reading your views ect i think it may be CS. i now have developed panic attacks which to be honest are destroying me hello tellboy, well i dont go to the gym i couldnt if i wanted to. my problems include my ribs hurting like nothing else, it is from my sternum to the bottom of my ribs, i liken it too a really bad chest infection. i also have pains in my clavicle, which sets off my shoulder pain, which then dominoes into my neck and headaches follow whic knock me off my feet for about 24hrs. i also have pains that radiate down my right arm mainly , into my fingers. i do have cs and have for alomost 19yrs now,try and getyour gp to send you for a mri, that will show if you have cs or not,,,, good luck xx chris"

          "First of all, thanks to everybody who has posted their experiences of cervical spondylosis (CS) on this forum, you have all helped me through a period which has lasted over 12 months not knowing if I was dying of cancer, heart attacks or sleeping in a draught. It started about 4 years ago with a few central chest pains, (by far the most scariest of all my symptoms), after visiting the appropriately named \\&quot;open chest clinic\\&quot; my heart was deemed as healthy'ish. The pains disappeared until January 2008 and then came back with a neck ache. Ignoring the neck ache as a \\&quot;posture\\&quot; concern my doctors sent me for another ECG, heart was still there and pumping well! His next idea was to give me gastro acid reducing tablets for a few months (I was complaining of Indigestion and trapped wind as a symptom too). On top of that he decided to treat me for high blood pressure and give me amitryptilene (for the still painful neck), I was now a walking zombie, so I decided to bin the amitriptilene. Finally x-rays were taken of my neck in June and the results read out by the doctor were, and I quote \\&quot;slight inflammation of the neck joints\\&quot;. Frequent and very costly trips to an osteopath and physiotherapist done nothing except drain the bank account savings and my pains in the neck gradually grew worse. A trip to the Endoscopy department was his next plan, no luck there either, so the stomach tablets are stopped too now. During this 11 month period I didn't know what was happening from one day to the next, the pains were usually worse when seated, the chest pains and pains in the top of my head come and go and I constantly feel \\&quot;unwell\\&quot;. Alcohol works...cannot get it on a prescription though and don't want to go down that road anyway. Pains/discomfort travel all around my upper half in a figure of eight, sometimes stomach, sometimes chest, sometimes lower back and always in my upper back or neck but very rarely together. I feel light headed but not dizzy, nauseous but not sick and the weirdest of all I feel terrible after a bath!!! Just been to see a new physio now and he called the surgery who read out the x-ray results and he turned to me and said \\&quot;you have CS\\&quot;. I don't feel any better but at least I know what it is!!!! Still loads of questions to ask, but I feel better for knowing what I have. 1. Are all of my symptoms linked to CS? 2. High blood pressure and Ibufuren are not a good mixture, what else can help? 3. Why does a bath make me feel unwell? 4. Why has the pain come on so quick, this time last year I was perfectly healthy and had only been to the doctors five times since leaving school ( I am now 45). I have been 10 times last year alone?. 5. Why is it worse when seated, I have had controllable pains over Xmas and my 1st day back to work today and I am in agony again? Any suggestions would be gratefully received....Happy New Year"

          " Hi Tammy, I had Lapidus surgery on April 10th on my right foot and a gastroc recession. I have 3 screws placed in my foot. I cannot comment on the plate because my doctor only placed screws. I had a nerve block and general anesthesia. I was extremely nervous about having this surgery. My doctor is absolutely wonderful. I have not experienced the pain that others have just discomfort. I am non weight bearing for 10 weeks. I hope this helps. Hi Tammy I had a bunion and 2 hammertoes surgery in February this year. I had two pins through my toes so had to wear surgical shoe for six weeks. Apart from the first few days which can be painful, the pain is definitely manageable after that. The only thing that has surprised me is that two months after surgery my foot is still a bit swollen and still have to hobble as toes are still stiff. I called the hospital last week and the nurse assured me that is normal and to expect us to 6 months before this it is back to normal. Hope this helps Meg <p>Hi Tammy,</p><p>I had a bunion removal with 2 screws to correct the bone alignment.</p><p>I also had a general anaesthetic and nerve block.</p><p>To be honest, I was in excruciating pain for the first week, with burning and throbbing when I put my foot down.

I don&#39;t know yet how I&#39;m going to feel about this, but I will check back often between now and your surgery date because I wish I had a resource like this prior to getting this done. It&#39;s not an easy surgery by any means and is much more complicated than I realized. I thought, &quot;a foot. big deal. doc says I won&#39;t feel improvement for a year. so what! it&#39;s getting worse. i have to act now before I&#39;m older and it&#39;s harder.&quot; &#160;Turns out, a serious foot surgery is a very big deal!

I have a 1-1/2&quot; incision over my 2nd toe metatarsal (weil procedure). And a 4&quot; incision down my big toe metatarsal. On the big toe, I know my surgeon cut one tendon, tightened a second, cut a wedge at the bottom to correct the angle and fused that part of the metatarsal bone to the smaller middle bone near the ankle. Not sure if they always do all of that in lapidus or not. I have several screws.</p><p></p><p>DAY 1: APRIL 13, 2017</p><p>Surgery - Get the anisthesia block in your leg. You will be very sorry if you don&#39;t, I suspect. I seemed great the first two days apparently (I remember very little except pain and lots of sleeping). I was on Vicodin (hydrocodone). I learned to take 1 every two hours instead of 2 every four hours, which helped to keep the pain level more bearable.</p><p></p><p>Get the anti-nausea and vomiting patch behind the ear too if they will give you one. And DON&#39;T TAKE IT OFF until you are CERTAIN it&#39;s not working.</p><p></p><p>Note: They say you need someone with you for 24 hours. IMO, you will need someone with you for a week minimum! &#160;It&#39;s been 10 days now and I cannot manage for myself with the crutches I have. My boyfriend is going to get me a roll-about knee scooter this afternoon. That is supposed to help tons. Crutches are very difficult when medicated. I almost fell over a bunch of times and the foot hurts like crazy when mobile because it&#39;s not high enough. I&#39;m going to wager, get a scooter in advance if you can. I will share more later this week after trying it. &#160;</p><p></p><p>Or at a minimum get a walker with a basket on it if you have to manage at all alone. Otherwise, I can&#39;t imagine how anyone could do this. You need ice every hour (behind knee works as good as it&#39;s going to get--at least for me). Food, bathroom. And you can&#39;t carry anything with crutches and a throbbing/burning foot.</p><p></p><p>Also, I ended up with a hassock in the bathroom to prop my foot on while I toilet (helps a bunch even just for short jaunts). And you will needs lots of pillows to prop you leg up virtually all the time anywhere you sit.</p><p></p><p>DAY 3, April 15 -</p><p>My block ran out about 36 hours after surgery, I&#39;d guess. (Surgery was Thursday afternoon. Saturday, I was becoming increasingly miserable.) The vicodin made it bearable, but it also made me feel awful mentally. I was not going to last long on this drug.</p><p></p><p>My foot also started cramping. My hammertoe correction felt permanently cramped straight up. Then the bunion incision and the bottom (Weil procedure) also started &quot;cramping&quot;. I was getting woken up by painful muscle spasms. It sucked.</p><p></p><p>DAY 4, April 16 -</p><p>Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning I decided the patch probably wasn&#39;t working anymore and had run out, since the anethesiologist told me it&#39;d probably last three days. I was wrong! It took off the patch and got very sick from the hydrocodone. (I can&#39;t take oxycodone. That was worse. I tried that first before surgery. Still pain and just sick.)</p><p></p><p>I had a SEARING headache that started the day before. Plus nausea from stupidly taking off that patch that was bugging me. I felt AWFUL!</p><p></p><p>I stopped taking the pain killers and resorted to Advil to stop the headache because it&#39;s Easter and the oncall nurse is telling me my symptoms sound like a drug reaction and I need to go to urgent care. I cannot go anywhere! A very, very bad day.</p><p></p><p>Also, muscle spasms and cramping continued and worsened. Sunday night I had a spasm so bad I screamed out loud and heard a loud cracking noise like bones breaking. I was terrified I had just had something go terribly wrong with my surgery and bones moving wrong.</p><p></p><p>I called the nurse hotline and the oncall doctor told me to loosen my wrapping on my foot and leave it undone for several minutes to let my foot relax and breathe. Then rewrap looser. Worked like a charm! Never had another serious spasm since.</p><p></p><p>Turns out the swelling was too much for the amount of room in the bandage and that&#39;s what was causing spasms. Also, my surgeon prescribed a muscle relaxer later to help further. It helped, but made me feel terrible mentally so I didn&#39;t take it again. (I am sensitive to drugs and don&#39;t like anything that makes me feel loopy or out of control. This is partly why I have had such a hard time with this surgery. If you are good with drugs, you might have a different experience.)</p><p></p><p>Note: Foot swelling is worst at night and first thing when I put my foot down in the morning. Over the day(s) it starts to get better during waking hours if I am diligent about ice and elevation. &#160;If I take pain medication and then do too much (at all), I pay for it shortly thereafter. Less is more right now!</p><p></p><p>DAY 5 -&#160;</p><p>I finally have a bowel movement. Screaming, viscious, whoozy, sweating pain. Worst so far. They mentioned I should drink lots of water and the pain killers might cause constipation. That little disclaimer was wholly insufficient. If you are taking pain meds, make sure you get some pericolace or ask your doctor about other alternatives or you will have more problems than your foot.&#160;</p><p></p><p>Don&#39;t remember much else this day. I am going to assume I was still quite miserable.</p><p></p><p>DAY 6 - Doctor&#39;s visit</p><p>Took off bulky wrap and rewrapped with just gauze and one ace bandage. Told me to start exercising my ankle. Gave me a short boot to protect the foot. Hurt to put it on because my ankle was swollen and it was digging into the side. Took it off promptly on returning home and putting my foot up. Does feel better to have my ankle crooked again when I can pull my foot back up toward my knee a bit.</p><p></p><p>Kept my foot down too long at the doctors and then waiting for new pain meds. Lots of swelling and pain. Overdid it.</p><p></p><p>Doc gives me Trammadol to try. I am willing. Pain is very intense still.</p><p></p><p>DAY 7 and 8 -&#160;</p><p>Don&#39;t remember much. Fairly miserable. Constant swelling. I did try the Trammodol. One does nothing for pain, but I don&#39;t feel sick. Two works, but I feel not good mentally. I don&#39;t like it. I still wake up every hour for MANY hours at night because of pain and swelling.</p><p></p><p>TIP: This sounds ridiculous, but a woman suggested it and I tried it. I don&#39;t believe in crystals even though I am an intuitive. (Don&#39;t think badly of me. I am also very down to earth and very grounded. I work normal work in addition to intuitive work.) Regardless, she told me to buy a small Amethyst *point* it&#39;s called. Just a little broken off shard off a larger Amethyst crystal cluster. And hold the bottom of the point shard about an inch or so off the surface of the injury/trauma (incision, bone work in this case) and aim the point away from the foot.</p><p></p><p>In my most desperate moments when the pain relief was not working and I was waking up every hour at night until 1, 2, 4am, I would lean up over my legs and hold that crystal as close to my surgery spots as I could without touching the bandages and I swear I could feel the different spots here and there that would pull when it was near them, and it did help with pain. Whether that was just my mental focus or not, I cannot swear, but it helped me and I am VERY grateful for that woman because that was all I had in those moments when I would feel so miserable. I would recommend it, actually, although I don&#39;t know if it will help someone who isn&#39;t used to intentionally feeling things in their body subtlely. It did help me.</p><p></p><p>Also, I finally learned that icing my foot directly over the bandage/injury causes more swelling for me!!! &#160;Keeping the ice behind my knee works MUCH better! Highly recommended ice behind knee and not on foot if direct cold causes you issues. Big tip for me when I figured it out!</p><p></p><p>On a less good note, I tried the Trammadol and had serious constipation problems again. More screaming pain.&#160;My boyfriend did a ton of research and it looks like Magnesium can solve the problem taking 200mg three times a day with food (or something similar). Google it. I haven&#39;t asked my doctor about it yet. But will on my next visit. Then maybe I could take some pain medication again. That would be nice! I will let you know what I find out.</p><p></p><p>DAY 9, Breaking point -&#160;</p><p>I go to bed in pain every night. I wake up in pain every morning. I am miserable and mentally broken. I had no idea this was going to be so painful or so hard. Just getting to the bathroom on my crutches is a total chore. Every time I put my foot down it hurts like crazy. My butt and hips and back are now getting sore too from sitting so much. My groin is cramping and tight from having my leg lifted in the same position all the time.&#160;</p><p></p><p>I finally google &quot;When will swelling end&quot; in relation to this procedure and find an old thread of three women going through all the same stuff for weeks. I cry and vent and finally post on facebook how miserable I am. I can&#39;t take three more weeks of this. I&#39;m not sure I can handle another day. The outpouring of support is huge. I finally have a good day after I get up and get moving a bit. I sit on the porch in the sun which helps a ton! (I just cover my toes so they don&#39;t burn or get hot.)</p><p></p><p>I also learn how to stretch my leg out behind me on a chair (standing on my other foot) with my injured foot pointed up toward ceiling and lunge forward to stretch tight groin. Helps a bunch!</p><p></p><p>I needed this. My brain was felt like breakdown that morning. I was mentally toast.</p><p></p><p>I decide to try acetominophen with food last night a couple of hours before bed. Perhaps it helped some.</p><p></p><p>DAY 10 - Today,</p><p>I slept from midnight or 1 am until after 8am today. This is the first night I&#39;ve slept through in 10 days. There is some sense of hope that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. My resilience mentally is better today, thankfully.</p><p></p><p>My body is worse. My foot has been swollen and painful since I woke up and ice isn&#39;t helping. Maybe I over did it yesterday because I was finally feeling a little better. Not sure.</p><p></p><p>But the pain is different somehow. I can tolerate it and block it out in a way. I am getting more numb to it sort of even though it still hurts. In fact, my foot is cramping right now. It sucks, but there is really nothing i can do. Maybe I will try some Tramadol with the Magnesium without waiting for the doctors OK of the Magnesium. Depends how long this carmping continues.</p><p></p><p>Right now I am going to unwrap and rewrap my foot perhaps and see if that helps? Not sure. Rewrapping at the proper tension proves to be difficult at best. But my foot is totally cramped right now. Argh!</p><p></p><p>Still, today for the first time in days I feel like I probably did make the right choice still. It wasn&#39;t getting better before. At least I have a chance.</p><p></p><p>==============================</p><p>&#160;SUMMARY SO FAR:</p><p>1) Prep well before surgery. Foot rests, knee scooter, attendant to stay with you at least a week, lots of pillows to prop your leg with.</p><p>2) Get the pain block at surgery and an anti-nausea patch is available.</p><p>2) Ice behind knee if trouble directly on bandage.</p><p>3) Find out how to combat constipation. (Magnesium?) Water in take doesn&#39;t cut it.</p><p>4) Take anti-nausea with pain killers after patch expires.</p><p>5) Amethyst point? Maybe? I am glad I have it.</p><p>6) Stretches on groin for elevated leg help with stiffness and aching.</p><p></p><p>I hope this helps. I am writing it all down because i don&#39;t want anyone else to not have a good current resource. It&#39;s hard enough. Strong support that is up to date is *so* helpful!</p><p></p><p>Hopefully someone else on here is current too! Reading on.</p><p></p><p>I&#39;ll keep you posted. Good luck!</p>"

          " Hi there, I have problems with my left arm on and off which also involves parts of my hand, as well as problems with my lower back with are mentioned plenty on this site !! As I have a background in science / pharma industry I understand what you are talking about, as I have always taken a keen interest in my own scans and any treatment. One : You are not being a wuss, nerve pain is one of the most difficult sorts of pain to treat and can be nasty. It is not easily treated by normal pain killers, that's why they tried you on low dose amitrptiline, they use it for nerve pain at a dose way lower than it is of use as an antidepressant. I have tried it and I didn't get on with it, it does have a lot of side effects, which even at a low dose affected me a lot ( hot sweats, like having flu ), but it works for some people ! Other nerve pain meds used are pregabalin and gabapentin, you'll find plenty of chatter on here about those too, can be good, I had it down as both the wonder pill and the pill from hell, and have tried both of them but in the end weaned myself off as had long term effects on my congnitive function that even 5 months after stopping it are affecting me. some people like it more than others. From a personal perspective I was 19 and at Uni when one morning I locked my neck whilst getting ready for lectures, and was left shoulder blade area that felt like a dagger had beeen plunged into it. It seems to be a weak spot ever since, I am now 41. In the last 10 years I have recurring problems with my left arm and nerve pain. At it's worst a few years ago my whole arm felt have and numb, the pain went into my little finger and rin finger and radiated into my thumb, and my hand clawed. They thought it was my ulnar nerve and sent me for tests, but that was negative. I saw a shoulder specialist and he said there was nothing wrong with shoulder. In the end the pain clinic dr I saw for my lower back offered to give me an epidural of steroid into the top par of my spine, and this did significantly reduce the pain and increase the mobility from shoulder blade thru to my fingers, I have only had it done the once but it really helped. It sounds like they know you have impingement on your nerve, and to my reckoning so long as that nerve is irritated you will bet pain and symptoms and poss. numbness. I have tingling in my outer fingers right now, but they have been worse !! I think you need a specialist opinion as to whether it is operable, if that means no pills as they all have poor side effect profiles !. You will not hurt it by trying to sue it, in fact if you avoid using it for any length of time it may get weaker and you may lose mroe function over time ( what I get told with my back all the time !!)....good luck, hope you get a good resolution. I raraely get more than 3/4 hrs sleep a night due to nerve pain and back pain, and I locked my neck and caused a flare up of my left arm taking a photograph of a Typhoon at Southport Air Show a month or so ago, I slepy an hour here and another hour there for 2 weeks until started to settle. If I lie on that side still though I wake up and cannot move my left arm. I think that the problems I have with mine were masked by my taking gabapentin / pregabalin for nerve pain assoc'd with my lower back problems, and now I ma off those meds its open season on any nerve pain !! Good Luck Hi D&R, I don't think anyone who hasn't experienced the type of pain we get can really understand. I once went to A&e and refused to leave until I got some relief. In the end I was given a cocktail of 3 drugs I took the prescription to the pharmacy in the hospital and took the first dose. It was only when I started getting some relief that I went home and spent the next few days like a zombie but oh the relief. I am currently getting relief with a combination of gabapentin, tramadol and amitriptline. I can't take anti inflammatorirs. I have also found osteopathy very helpful. The pain clinic has also helped with physio and now an exercise programme which I will start next Thursday. I definitely think you should be off work. I do hope the surgeon can help. My injections, one in the spine has worked wonders. I have also had two in my hand to treat trigger finger Good luck and take care of yourself. D Hello Just thought I'd update. Eventually went back to doctors as wasn't getting any relief and couldnt cope with work due to pain and no sleep. Doctors response was \"there must be something else going on with you for you to react like this\". Eventually convinced him the pain was bad so he put me on pregabalin and signed me off work for two weeks. He also said he'd put in for an emergency referral for me due to the loss of movement and strength in right hand. After two weeks the pain had calmed down so went back to work. Came off the pregablin and cocodomal and didnt sleep for a week. Walked round like a zombie. Had to chase the appointment myself as the GP cancelled my original appointment when they sent over the letter requesting an emergency one. Was panicking I'd have to wait even longer. Was calling the hospital every hour and getting no response. Eventually had to make a guess on what a secretaries email address was and finally got a response. Once I contacted a real person directly she was really helpful, even calling me with the date of my appt before it was official. Saw surgeon on 5 Dec. He said I have the option of leaving it and hoping it doesn't get worse but its not going to get better without surgery. 80% chance of improvement with surgery. 1 in 300 chance of being paralysed which I am really stressing about. I am also stressed by the fact that I have been dizzy for about three weeks and not sure if its my neck or a virus causing it but hopefully it will be gone by the time of my preop assessment. Jan , if not I will tell them. I think the lesson I'm taking from all this is you don't get anywhere without making a fuss which is hard for an ill patient when the Doctor is making you feel like you are making a fuss over nothing.I had to more or less have a breakdown in the surgery before they would take the pain even semi seriously. Also don't trust NHS admin. Everything seems to be 20 years out of date and they still use faxes to communicate. I had to get my GP to refax everything aa couple of times and then ring the hospital with the exact time it was faxed over so they could find it. A couple of days ago I got a second letter asking me to come for a referral appointment with another surgeon.  Hi I just came across this forum, worried about my own issues which seem very similar. How are you going? I would appreciate any insights or info re progress you may have made. I am in NZ so some treatment options may vary, but overall pretty similar. I have nerve pain and both thumbs have trigger thumb the right thumb in particular has lost a lot of movement, I wonder if i will ever get it back. But its the neck pain that is diabolical, horrible situation that has been going on for months and still waiting for results from an MRI, and still trying to hang in with work, barely coping with one day a week. I am juggling painkillers and finding none of them are particularly good and often make me feel weird and spacey. Can anyone tell me there is light at the end of this tunnel? <p>Hi there,</p><p></p><p>I am so sorry to hear everyone&#39;s chronic pain but I can totally feel for all of you. I was involved in a RTA 3 years ago and it has left me with severe chronic syndrome pain in the neck and shoulders. I have issues sleeping, dressing and just being able to have a better quality of life, I have also taken all the painkillers which have not helped but if anything have given me a lot of side affects. I am lecturer which makes it even harder to be able to teach, plan and maneuvere. I was off work for 6 months after the accident I list numbness in my left side even since the accident it&#39;s just escalated to chronic. I have tried so many private interventions the osteopath treatment is better than physio the staff work on the direct nerve area and trigger points also acupuncture / capping also helps for the whole spine. ...Unfortunately you get some relief but the pain is still chronic....I have forgotten what it feels like to sleep i wake up every 3 hrs in pain I can&#39;t lie on my back the neck aches or on my shoulder side left/right. You need to have regular interventions at a pain management hospital I live in London and visit the national neurologist hosp which is fantastic.....I have nerve infusions, trigger point injections and sculpular procedures on my shoulder .....I&#39;m gping in again in 2 weeks for the sculpular shoulder procedure on the left and more trigger points in the neck. ...my pain has got worse I&#39;ve realised that I need these injections every 2 months not 4 months it&#39;s been 4 know and I am in so much pain ...I would also recommend hydrotherapy a warm pool with physio exervises especially for issues with your lower back. ...I would also advice anyone who is in serious pain to diffinately take time off so you can try some of these interventions emotionally when you are in a lot of pain people cannot see from the outside that you are suffering and of you are like me I have to try and laugh wheb I&#39;m in agony otherwise I will just burst out crying. You also cannot perform to your best ability so take time off to sleep as much as you can with the medication that allow you to do so. ...try and build up your energy! Wish me luck going in for injections in two weeks I am counting the days!&#128533;</p>"

          "Hello, an old recurring neck issue has started up again for me. It reoccured in July and has been gradually getting worse. I'ts my back and all down my right arm and hand. A couple of weeks ago it got so bad I did not sleep at all for four nights in a row. It has settled a bit but have only had a couple of hours the last two nights. I've had an MRI and am being referred to a surgeon. The main problem area is c6/c7. The disk has degenerated and the bone has grown so the opening for the nerve has got smaller. My chiropractor explained this to me from the report. GP just said it was a disk problem and didn't seem to have read the report properly. I have booked my appt with the surgeon but the earliest (only) appt available was in January. GP initially gave me naproxin, but as it wasn't helping he then gave me amitriptyline. This didn't help the pain either so I went back and the nurse prescribed co-codomal. Nothing really seems to be touching the pain. In the last few days my right hand has stopped functioning properly. can't control it very well - hard to type with. Am trying to avoid using it as it hurts when i do. Am I right to be worried or is this all temporary and should I wait for the appt in January? Is there any point seeing a Chiropractor? Am I just being a wimp about the pain? When I try to explain how bad it is to the GP and nurse they just seemed uninterested. Should I ask to be signed off from work as commuting and having to sit at a desk seems to make it worse? Sorry for all the questions - I think I am getting into a bit of a state mentally. Any opinions welcome."

          " Your mind is working overtime, you wish you could stop these thoughts If only there was a way to stop them, if only you'd been taught You take each day as it comes take each step as you see them, as the Latin say 'carpe diem' Life doesn't always turn out the way you hoped it'd go, you're feeling weak insecure or just generally low But there's always a way out you just need to seek Pick yourself up, be strong, stand on you're own two feet Everyone in life have their ups and downs, you're certainly not alone Life's never as bad as you think, nothing is set in stone So don't let yourself be brought down by hurt, sadness nor hate You can change things if you try, you can decide your own fate So if you're feeling alone or just maybe a little sad don't dwell on what you haven't got and think of the things you have!  Panic \" my breathing hurries, i'm overwhelmed by heat I start to shake from my head to my feet My chest tightens up, feel like I'm going to die I wait it out till it passes then I can't help but cry Cos it's the scariest thing to ever go through, not knowing what's wrong or what to do I walk out the door and I'm scared right away, I think that at home I should have stayed Cos when I'm out in public I'm always so wary, my heart always races, it's always so scary I hope that soon I'll be on the mend, hope they'll go away hope that they'll end Cos I won't these feelings to be no more, for things to go back to how they were before I hate these attacks that I have endured, I weep as I wonder if I'll ever be cured. 'Just because'\" Just because you don't see me cry, it doesn't mean that I'm not sad Just because I seem to have a lot, it doesn't mean I have Just because I laugh and Joke and smile a lot of the time, it doesn't mean I'm happy, It doesn't mean I'm fine If only you could understand, if only you could see, that the girl you see on the outside is not the real me!  Everyday I pretend, everyday I'm playing the role, of someone who is happy, who's life is in control But this is far from the truth, it's all an act you see, cos the truth is I'm not happy, the truth is I don't like being me When a new day comes I wish it hadn't came, because I know no matter what I do I'll always feel the same I laugh and joke about with friends as if I haven't got a care, but at night I feel so lonely because nobody is there Feels like the world is leaving me behind while it just keeps moving on, feel like I'm not a part of it, feel like I don't belong Feel sad about this hand that I've been given, just because I'm alive it doesn't mean that I'm living!  Thoughts'\" These thoughts in my head go round and round, so I've put pen to paper and wrote them all down Sometimes life's funny with the way things go, but I don't see the amusement when I'm feeling this low There's a lot of things in my life that get me down, but because I'm a mum i have to hide my frown I hide my troubles, my worries, my fears, I hide the hurt and I hide the tears Sometimes my whole body aches and hurts And I think..\"can my life get any worse? I wake in the morning and I know that it's time, to do it all again, to pretend that I'm fine! Today has been hard, been feeling really low, had no one I can talk to, had nowhere I could go So I sit myself down, take out my pen, open my book and write a poem again I write down these thoughts and feelings of mine, as I find it easier to express them through rhyme You see this book its like my journal, it helps fill an empty space and somehow as I'm writing, the words fall into place In a way it's a comfort as I can read them Back and see, how tough the days can sometimes get For me I can also see the changes I need to make, where things started to go wrong, where I'm making my mistakes So I'll keep writing these poems for as long as I feel the need, until the sadness goes away and the happy me is Freed!  'Nobody knows'\" People are always telling me to cheer up but they haven't got a clue, they don't understand that it's not that simple, they don't know what I go through But I don't blame these people, in a way they're just naive, it's the way they see things, it's just how they perceive But only I know, only I know it to be true, that the way I feel and act sometimes is not just me feeling blue There's a whole lot more beneath all that, a whole lot more besides, they don't understand the battle I fight, how every day I try to hide The hurt and pain inside of me, they just don't see at all, How they see life as a happy thing yet I just see it as cruel!  'Cutting'\" Do you sit alone feeling scared and afraid? Do you stop and reach for the nearest blade? Do you cut to release the tension? Are your thoughts full of frustration? Are you like me or am I just dumb? Is it just me who's minds constantly numb? Please tell me that I'm normal Please tell me that it's okay Am I the only one that can't keep my feelings at bay? One minute I'm fine one minute life makes sense, the next I make these cuts at my minds expense! I wish I could stop I wish I knew how Wish someone could relate to the way Im feeling now Slit my arm to watch it bleed It's not something that I want, it's something that I need To feel the pain to see the blood spill Anything to stop the way That I feel Oh god this is stupid I don't need you to tell I know I should stop but wish I knew how I just want someone to relate, want someone to see, to tell me that I'm normal and there's nothing wrong with me The truth is I don't want to do this to myself! The truth is Im just crying out for help!  I try to change things in every way, but nothing's ever different, it's just like Groundhog Day The same bad things repeating over and over, where's my luck? Where's my four leaf clover? I don't know why I bother even wanting more as things just stay as they were before I have to lie in it for I have made my bed, try to stop thinking of what could have been instead So I'll let things play out even though they're not that great, but my life is what it is, maybe is just fate? So I won't try to change things cos what will be will be, the sooner that I realise that the sooner that I'll see That most things in life are beyond our control, we're just pawns in life's game, I'm just playing my role!  Storm' \" As single teardrop falls from my eye, the clouds grey over in the sky When it rains it pours, it's like a raging storm, My mind is in tatters, my heart is torn I hope and I pray that the day will come, when even through storms I can see the sun. \"Dear Mr 'D' (depression) \" Dear Mr D why are you here? Making me miserable and living in fear, casting your shadow all around, at every turn pulling me down Dear Mr D why have you came, is it something I did? am I to blame? I wish you'd go, why won't you leave? Stop suffocating and let me breathe I've fought with my body, my mind, my soul, but I can't cope anymore, I'm losing control I'm scared, I'm sad, I'm all alone, I can't get through this on my own I've tried and tried for far too long, but I can't fight anymore you're just too strong!!! Dear Mr D why can't you see just what it is you are doing to me. I had an ok day today, was good, I managed a smile, but the feeling didn't extend to tonight, it only lasted a little while I thought that maybe things would change but all alas alack, as soon as I feel I could be happy the sadness comes rushing back But I will keep on fighting, I'll keep on pushing through, for it's the only way I know how, it's just what I have to do So I'll end this poem now before I say goodnight, As I'm going to need all my strength for tomorrow's fight!  I wear a mask so that I can disguise, the hurt and pain that I feel inside It comes with a smile, laughter and fun, for I can't show my true feelings to anyone I wear it so that I can pretend none of its real, this pain, hurt and sadness I feel  I'm suffocated by my thoughts, i'm crushed by my pain, I'm overwhelmed by emotions I can't contain I torment myself everyday, for these feelings I cannot keep at bay I'm stuck with this burden, I'm stuck with this guilt, I'm stuck with the mountain of pressure that's built I live in the past and I can't move on, I just want to forget, I want to be strong But because of what happened, I can't let it go, I can't talk to anyone they just won't know They won't understand, they'd think I'm bad, that I'm a horrible person, that I deserve to feel sad "
