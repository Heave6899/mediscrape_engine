          " You should see a neurologist specializing in TD. Mine diagnosed my disorder after studying my physical symptoms and, listening to me, within 30 minutes. Presently I am taking Xenazine but overtime causes TD... In about a month I will switch to Austedo which treat TD specifically. I wish you the best of luck in finding the right neurologist. <p>Hi. &#160;You are right TD is damage to brain caused by medication; &#160;and doctors have known about it for many decades. &#160;I got TD from the anti-psychotic Geodone. &#160;I found out later that I had taken similar drugs for years.</p><p></p><p>Why in the hell you were given such a dangerous drug for acid reflux is beyond me .... for me, it was some treatment-resistant form of life-long depression.</p><p></p><p>I wonder how old are you? &#160;I&#39;m now 68. &#160;For me, it&#39;s at least 10 years ....I cannot answer you about anger ..... depression is my usual state. &#160;But, Good for you !! &#160;Get angry for the rest of us.</p><p></p><p>How can I help you ....&#160;</p><p></p><p>First, what do you know now about the drug&#160;metaclopramide&#160;?</p> <p>F**k being positive. The only thing I&#39;m positive about it that we got screwed over-why should I chose to let out my anger in away that&#39;s controlled and deemed acceptable by society that doomed me to this fate? A life of limitations which i am shamed for when i cannot support myself or do what others expect of me because of them. Just now my own mother excuse me of riding the system because my disability did not allow me to work, so not only do I have to deal with the pain I am going through, but the pain of being told by people I should take it gracefully and be okay with it. and only react in ways that suit them.&#160; My muscle spasms didn&#39;t censor themselves when I was crying out in pain, hoping for them to stop just briefly. Succumbing to society will never create change. I want to do more than vent and meditate on why I shouldnt feel the way I feel or act out. I want to fight. It&#39;s time we got what we deserve.</p> <p>OK. &#160;I&#39;ll help .... where do we start?</p><p></p><p>Does anyone else suspect that tar dive dyskinesia eventually expands or worsens? &#160;I seem to have painful dystonia in my neck, which many many efforts and MDs cannot address (maybe they don&#39;t even believe me?)</p><p></p><p>This condition, worse than my TD, is devastating my life. &#160;Sometimes I want to give up. &#160;</p><p></p><p>Again, anybody think TD can go into the neck?</p> <p>Has anyone looked into BOTOX ? &#160;I&#39;m inclined to try it .... tomorrow, actually.</p><p></p><p>Katie, do you have an idea of How to express our anger? &#160;Also on Disability --- no, just retired now, so these should be my good days. &#160;Bah Humbug .... &#160;I could say worse. &#160;I wonder what you said that admins deleted ?</p><p></p><p>There are brain-fogging reasons to be skeptical of drugs used to treat TD ---- a class of drugs known as anticholinergics and many others with anti-cholinergic effects. &#160;One won&#39;t hurt you, but used in combo w/ several others will cause dementia symptoms. &#160;It happened to me.</p><p></p><p>I found a long list of them; many are over the counter remedies ... like pills to sleep or to stop diarrhea. &#160;Xanax is one.</p><p></p><p>I&#39;m going to go look up my muscle relaxant Baclofen right now.</p><p></p><p>later.</p>"

For past almost 3 years now, I suffered immensely, condition constantly evolving. It began anxiety intense brain fog, point I couldn&#39;t drive I felt unsafe. I excruciating, unexplained pain body, painful muscle twitches/spasms, many outwardly visible (some were) feeling actual sensation body/head shaking rapidly made nauseated irritable. On top this, normal body processes disrupted, I got worse symptoms I sick immunity compromised, I punished body (in form overwhelming brain fog worsened shaking/spasms) I got aroused boyfriend, stayed late, thought hard, listened music wrong time, ate certain foods, got acid reflux (which time since that&#39;s I taking medication begin with.) Many thing evolved systematically-meaning symptoms changed slightly got better constant cycle things getting better worse little better before, I reached point I now.</p><p></p><p>I tired medical community treating like side affect, allergic reaction, unfortunate plague hit community people. I poisoned.

TD isn&#39;t \u201ccondition\u201d, form brain damage. They damaged brains. Why letting fool us? They maimed us left us dead, basically- left freaks life limitations pain support (monetary, emotional, treatment-wise) help us through.

          " Hi TriciaK I am very sorry to hear you're suffering with TD. I too have possibly TD (my neurologist has decided to keep me sane psychologically and say it's a functional movement disorder!) and have lip smacking, grimacing and tongue movements - all from one week's worth of the anti-psychotic pericyazine! I am utterly embarassed and annoyed that my life has been irreversibly changed by such evil drugs and want to really try and reach out to anyone who has the same condition. My neurologist actually described my condition as 'functional orobuccal symptoms' and I am also at a loss for anyone who understands and treats it. We are very much alone I'm afraid and I feel so depressed evert day. I am on Citalopram at the moment and it seems to mask the symptoms but I am scared to come off them for fear of the TD getting worse. I'll reply with a longer message soon xx Also, I have only managed to meet one other person in the UK online who has the same disorder, and has tardive dystonia too, poor lady. The medical profession is a disgrace and should be really under fire for prescribing such powerful meds for (me) which was anxiety and insomnia. I hate the thought of being like this forever - I know it's a very negative outlook but I'm only 35 tomorrow (!) and have suffered with this for just 4 months. It feels like years, and God knows how I'll get through the rest of my days like this. Most people are understanding but it's the odd moments when I'm in public or a quiet place and the lip smacking becomes noticeable, not to mention the odd sensations in my tongue from constantly rubbing against my bottom teeth. I would go so far as to get deep brain stimulation to get some relief and quality of life. No-one else seems to be so freakish and lip smack / tongue protrusion all the time. I do feel very alone like you say, and a bit of a freak :| By the way, please forgive any typos and fractured sentences, I'm yet to find the 'edit' button!  I'm from the East of England btw and am finding it tough getting my head around the fact these symptoms don't seem to let up much and keep on coming. I actually found another lady on the Dystonia society forum pages with a post about a year ago,and how she had the tongue symptoms of her tongue pushing against her bottom teeth... Exactly what I have. It is so odd to think such a chemical imbalance can cause such disabling and uncomfortable symptoms :-( Xx Hi my name is marianne. I am going through the same thing as you.years of missdiagnosis now after years on first generation antipsychotic meds which i complained were making me ill a gp suddenly diagnosed me with TD after i looked up my symptoms. I also have dystonia and akanisia from the meds.I have a lot of health problems and the gps said my pain was hypercondria and i had mild bipolar and psychosis .I believe bought on by an anxiety causing lack of sleep which turned me psychotic. I had high blood sugar due to meds and they said i was not diabetic and high liver enzymes and got jaundice of skin,they said it was all in my head. tried to sue the gp for not reviewing meds in 3 years and they told my solisitors a load of lies so they would not take on the case and told me to stay on the antipsychotic meds,even psychiatrist said the same. I changed gps and because the olsd surgery lied about me i was only alowed to see 2 gps.one i was rolling on floor at surgery in gripping stomach pain and one of my gps said as he walked past angrily get up marianne ,just get up and stop ringing surgery. on one lucky occasion my gp was off and they let me see another,he was brill, he took one look at me and said your looking a bit jaundiced better order liver function tests and that night i was in hospital for 3 nights with liver enzymes so elevated billarubin 225 instead of 20 alt 400 not 30 and gamma gt 700 not 40.i had gaul stones. they let me out saying i would need an opp and the nice gp saw me again and asked y the hospital didn't test for pancreatitis and orderd blood test which came back possitive then i was addmited to hospitala nd was on a glucose drip for 3 days given an mri altho last gps said i couldnt have one as i had been sterilised using metal clips which was a lie and was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis due to a gaul stone getting into my duct and causing imflamation and i was put on antibiotics.when i could eat they tested my blood sugar and it was 20 not below 6 and now i am diabetic and the hospital said all this was caused from my long term use of the antipsychotic med which my gp said i should take so did psychiatrist and said mind benefits more then the fact my blood sugar was going up 2 years ago tested by my mum on her machienand gp went mad when i told her i took my reading and said diet and excersise.now as a result of all thease health conditions i have fibromyalgia too and am going to rhumatologist as have other symptoms and worried i have med induced lupus.i also have sores in my mouth and gp takes no notice.my bones in my back are hurting all time and my legs too.my muscles are messed up and have lost 3 stone in 6 months my new gps neglected me on lies old gp said and the only 2 gps who i am alowed to see are taking their neglect out on me by not refuring me to rhumey and saying they have think she is scared they may find something else.other gp told me to take 4 diabetic pills a day hospital said one for now.i got a chest infection so couldnt have gaul bladder out smoked cos of stress being called a lier for 8 months and i had given up for over 7 years.now on e cig to give up. my psychiatrist cancelled my appointment and isnt seeing me for 2 weeks and all i am alowed to take is diazapam and am not being given anything else to calm the stress they caused because hospital wrote all my conditions were caused from antipsychotic meds. i understand what you are going through,the lip smaking and twitchy eyes and shakes and inner tremmors and heart palpertations are driving me mad and i can barly walk due to back and leg pain. my house is council rented and full of toxic black mold which makes me more ill with chronic rhyonitis and nose bleeds and confusion and depression and i believe i was wrongly diagnosed for years ,even my nice psychologist said clearly im not a hypercondriac as i have seriouys health conditions and haveing no sleep for 3 days due to stress would turn anyone psychotic and the lies they wrote about me s to solisitors saying im anurexic,lol i was 13 stone dur to anti psychotic making me eat and sleep all day and now i lost weight suddenly due to diabetis that they said i didnt have,they said i was schitso and had hypercondria so the solisitors wont take it on.

          " It is schizophrenia,IDK how the not got there. My son, now 26, has had schizophrenia for the past none years. I feel he has never gotten the best treatment. He is currently on clozapine 350mg and is experiencing many mannerisms that he tries to mask with constant movement. Can Mayo clinic help ease his discomfort? Hello @lisaben, Welcome to Connect. I just want to let you know that you are not alone. Our son was also diagnosed with schizophrenia in his early teens and spent over a year in the hospital and when they gave up on him, he spent six months in a state hospital where the goal was to help him learn to live with his condition along with the medications. He's now in his mid 50's and doing really well but the first 10 years were tough on him and my wife and I. What really helped was finding a local support group associated with the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). They have some good information you might find helpful along with a search tool to locate a local support group here \u2013 https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Schizophrenia/Support. I think the best thing that helped our son was being able to manage his medications so that he is able to function and keep a job. Early on it was difficult for me because I don't think I understood how important it was for me to respond calmly when he was having difficulty. It was extremely helpful to have a local support group with other parents in the same situation and being able to share experiences. Over the years his diagnosis was changed to manic depression and his doctors tried several medications until finding one that worked the best for him. Do you have a local support group in your area? In reply to @johnbishop \"Hello @lisaben, Welcome to Connect. I just want to let you know that you are not...\" + (show) Hi John, Thank you for replying so quickly. I have joined NAMI and went to Family to Family about 7 years ago. Then I became a facilitator through Indianapolis but the group I joined was not recognized for some reason and it got political. We have not met since Covid. I am so happy that your son was able to find his way. Thankfully for my son, he has tremendous family support and a lot of love. Without his brothers, this once popular athlete would have no friends. They all abandoned him in high school bc of his behavior. Unfortunately, the negative symptoms are most prominent in my son, and his illogical thinking keeps him from sustaining a job. Now with his mannerisms increasing, he is getting stranger. I wonder if the mannerisms are precipitated by boredom? It\u2019s so hard to see him circling the house every day with nothing to do. I try to take him places and he likes to go out with his brothers. Honestly, we have yet to find a doctor that really cares. The U of Chicago doctor did not warn me about how much clozaril we would have to achieve for therapeutic effect. He landed in the hospital after trying to kill my husband. U of C has no inpatient for mental illness, so he spent 7 weeks at Regional. His doctor never followed up. We moved to St. Catherine hospital with a doctor he likes who did both in and outpatient, but he rarely kept appointments being stretched so thin. He was fired. Now we have a nurse practitioner and I find myself checking his clozapine levels through my chart. I am his advocate. By law, blood tests must be taken but the doctors are too busy to check if the levels are too high or too low. A month ago, after adding another med, his levels were double the highest range. I alerted the doctor. Shouldn\u2019t this be the other way around? I seek better care for him. I know he could be on a better place for his normal. I just can\u2019t find a doctor with the experience, time and concern for him. If you know of anyone, I am all ears. In reply to @lisaben \"Hi John, Thank you for replying so quickly. I have joined NAMI and went to Family...\" + (show)     Our son is in the Mayo Clinic system but I'm not sure who his doctor is currently. When he was a teenager he had to have the regular blood tests also and I think he was on clozapine but I'm not sure. His meds have changed several times since the early years. He's now taking olanzapine and citalopram which can have a drug interaction rare side effect of increasing the heart rhythm but fortunately it hasn't been a side effect for him. I do think it's important for your son to have a doctor that he likes and can communicate with. I don't believe his current medications require blood testing. I think the medications have gotten better since our son was diagnosed so it might be worth checking with his doctor if you think the meds aren't helping. A few times early in his diagnosis our son had stopped taking his meds and had a setback. Now he's really good at taking his meds and keeping a regular schedule. I don't know if it's helpful for you but I did see an article on clozapine versus olanzapine that explains the difference and how it works. Also, included an article on another promising medication. \u2014 Clozapine versus olanzapine for people with schizophrenia: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6517029/ \u2014 Promising New Medications for Schizophrenia: https://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/fixing-the-system/features-and-news/4263-research-weekly-new-medication-schizophrenia Mayo Clinic has some good doctors in their Psychiatry and Psychology department if that is an option \u2013 https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/psychiatry/doctors. Do you think your local NAMI office might have some recommendations for a doctor? Thank you so much! I am going to check out those articles right now. I believe he tried olanzapine before he was on the invega injection. I would love to find a psychiatrist/neurologist. I will investigate if Mayo has an opening. I know NAMI, at least our local, will not recommend doctors but they do discuss the ones that are known in the area. The problem is, many have left their practices and there is a tremendous shortage.

If you would like to explore if Mayo Clinic might be right for your son, you can start by submitting an online appointment request form. This will allow you to set up a phone call with a coordinator to ask more questions about physicians and options. Here's a link to the form and more information: http://mayocl.in/1mtmR63 How are you doing today? In reply to @lisaben \"Thank you so much! I am going to check out those articles right now.

I take Invega which is in the same class of drugs, the atypical antipsychotics. Some of the newer ones, have fewer such side effects. I do have similar movements, and my doctor put me on Cogentin for it. It helps but does not 100% eliminate them. In my case, the movements are in my feet and hands (mostly feet), occasionally the face. I also have some restlessness. I would say it's 80-90% improved. It's important for him to talk to his doctor. I understand your frustration. My son has been prescribed Abilify injection (2016) his tremors have become very noticeable. His head now bobs and his hands are moving unintentionally. He was a patient at MAYO last year. It is a hopeless feeling when you\u2019ve asked for help to know avail. I feel for you. Ability isn't supposed to ha e as many side effects.

Through your information, I don\u2019t feel like I am searching for a needle in a haystack. Now, to find a doctor that would be willing to take a look at my son's TD. The condition is known as tardive dyskinesia and is a common side-effect of the use of antipsychotic medications such as the one your son is currently taking. This is not a well-understood side effect and affects patients in s variety of ways as well as levels of intensity. These are involuntary spasms which include symptoms like your son's. This should be brought to the attention of his therapist as soon as possible. An alternative antipsychotic may help and medications have been and are being developed to counteract these disturbing physical symptoms. Other symptoms can include licking the lips, the tongue darting in and out, unusual blinking and even verbal shouts or noises of short duration. This can easily affect your son's self-confidence as people around him can find these symptoms frightening and authority figures such as police officers may misinterpret these involuntary symptoms as rudeness, or 'street drug' induced. So it is best to seek medical advice as soon as possible. At present, there is no 'cure' for this, and it may be permanent even if the anti-psychotic treatment is interrupted or a substitute drug is employed. People on long-term SSRI and SSNI medications for depression are also occasionally being discovered with the development of this disturbing physical issue. The good news is that with the sweeping advancements in genetics, new and more efficacious treatments are coming forward every day. It is the social consequences which can make this condition potentially dangerous through the overreaction of a member of the public or police. Until some resolution is found working with your doctor, it might be wise for your son to carry a doctor's note in his wallet or some kind of medical bracelet, that would indicate that he has a 'neurological' condition that causes involuntary body movement or facial expressions that are entirely benign, carry no danger to others and are not under his control. CAUTION: This condition does not develop in everyone using antipsychotic medications or some types of anti-depressants. NEVER abruptly discontinue the use of your medication or that of the person for whom you are caring. This could be very dangerous. Seek medical advice before stopping any prescribed medication.

Movements started with a slight shake in his left hand. I noticed this while he was eating dinner. Unfortunately at the psychiatrist\u2019s meetings, they could not observe his head bobbing or hand movements. I insisted that there were involuntary bodily movements. Months later it was discussed the condition of the condition of tardive dyskinesia. This could be effect from his antipsychotic medication. They have noticeably increased in the last few months. Most recently Botox was discussed to be place in the neck to help with the spasms. He was not in favor of this treatment. If the prescribed medication Abilify was brought to a lower dose he was concerned of a psychotic episode. His brain scans and MRIs are at Mayo. I am wondering if there is a blood test that would determine the levels of Abilify in his system. Thank you, @hopeful1953"

          " Hi @jay_baruch. A warm welcome to Connect! Thanks for sharing your experience. I\u2019m so glad to hear you feel you\u2019ve found something that is working. I\u2019m tagging @mztbaker, @14gardens, @reichertolivia12 and @nickjr who have all posted about Abilify though it was some time ago. And @jharsh, @Gavin, @kcollins719, @hils, @kdecker003, @claudia11 and @davewinps have more recently posted about Lexapro so if they have any relevant experiences, I hope they\u2019ll share them with you. Can I ask what made you consider adding the Abilify? Was the Lexapro just not cutting it any more? In reply to @kelseydm \"Hi @jay_baruch. A warm welcome to Connect! Thanks for sharing your experience. I'm so glad to...\" + (show) Sorry that I missed doing a search first, new to the site navigation. I was going thru a switch from Lexapro, which works pretty well for me with minimal side effects, to Cymbalta to help with chronic arthritic pain. (I have Crohn\u2019s, so no NSAID\u2019s.) I got very irritable on Cymbalta, so back to Lexapro only for a month, but still bad episodes. The Abilfy effect was pretty dramatic on day three, my critical mind was put into a corner, and sudden drops in mood stopped. No worries at all. I know the site can be a little daunting to navigate at first. I tag people more so they\u2019ll get an email alert and hopefully come back and respond Based on your experience with Cymbalta, you might be able to contribute to this group: https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/is-there-a-generic-version-of-cymbalta-60mg-yet/ Isn\u2019t it amazing how quickly the right med can help?! I had significant weight gain on Abilify. Since I already had type 2 diabetes my doctor asked me to ask my psych prescriber about a change. I was changed to Latuda. I have heard about weight gain and read about blood sugar. With Crohn\u2019s I\u2019m not worried about the weight, fortunately (?). Thank you for sharing your experiences. I had a very bad experience with Abilfy. I had fallen and hit my head and had several related problems. I had a preliminary diagnosis of Parkinson. A \u201cscope\u201d said I had Parkinsonism. I had many symptoms of Parkinson. Then I saw a \u201cmovement psychaitrist\u201d and he diagnosed drug induced Parkinson. He took me off Abilfy and all symptoms disapeard. Hi, I know the patent protection for Abilify (in Canada) ended a few months ago. Does anyone know of a generic replacement available yet, or have any idea when this may happen? Thanks.

I\u2019m so glad you decided to join our community. I moved your post to this thread since there was already an ongoing conversation about Abilify. You are correct. As of 2015 the patent on Abilify expired and the brand is exposed to generic competition and a generic form has been available since 2015. Here is drug information from Health Canada http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/medeff/reviews-examens/abilify-eng.php. And, here is a more consumer-friendly description: http://www.rexall.ca/articles/view/1974/Abilify. Are you taking Abilify? What has been your experience with the medication? In reply to @sallycanuck \"Hi, I know the patent protection for Abilify (in Canada) ended a few months ago. Does...\" + (show) Hi @kelseydm, Thanks for the Rexall link\u2026really helpful. My sister has been on it for over a year. It was prescribed by a family doctor, not a psychiatrist and from my research it appears that it is inappropriate and possibly dangerous to go \u201coff label\u201d, especially as it is not being used in conjunction with an Ssri. She has a slight heart murmur (congenital) and is 60 yrs old. She has gained over 25 pounds and smokes 2 packs a day. She says the Abilify (just changed to generic Citralopram 40 mg) has helped her anxiety, but I am concerned for her. Can anyone comment on using Abilify alone for anxiety? Thanks so much. Sorry everyone. I just realized Citalopram is not Abilify, but rather an actual Ssri. So sorry for the confusion. In reply to @sallycanuck \"Hi, I know the patent protection for Abilify (in Canada) ended a few months ago. Does...\" + (show) @sallycanuck , I take generic Abilify (aripiprazole), 2mg, to supplement my SSRI for depression, not anxiety. Since I do take another script (Neurontin/Gabapentin) for GAD, I cannot say if the aripiprazole would be helpful for that or not. Citralopram is not generic Abilify but rather Celexa, an SSRI, so maybe she is taking the Abilify to supplement that? Most of these drugs can cause a propensity for weight gain, not so much for me as I have Crohn\u2019s disease. I was on the starting dose of Abilify and had bad insomnia. I got off it at my next Dr. appointment. Hi @book2075, thanks for sharing your experience with Abilify with the group. Your insights are much appreciated! What were you taking Abilify for? @sallycanuck, how is your sister doing? Has the medication helped? In reply to @alysebrunella \"Hi @book2075, thanks for sharing your experience with Abilify with the group. Your insights are much...\" + (show) Hi @alysebrunella\u2026thanks for checking in. My sister is doing fine\u2026on her citalopram boosted by Abilify.Only down side is the weight gain. Glad it\u2019s working for you. Watch out for involuntary leg, arm and even head jerks and report them to your doc ASAP. They can continue years after you discontinue the medication and even become permanent. And yes, this is the voice of experience talking. I was diagnosed with tardive dyskinesia more then 16 years ago when I was taking trilafon and then Zyprexa. Needless to say it was disturbing. The neurologist said there was nothing that could be done, and it would continue to get worse. I had uncontrollable head movements, and tongue movements. Fortunately with changes in my meds, those major symptoms went away. Other symptoms continued. Then after researching the internet and noticing I had a sensitivity to light. Especially flouresent light, I decided to start using sunglasses which have really helped. I use them even when using the computer and watching tv. I also take 2 mg melatonin and 2000 units D3 at night. I take these supplements after much trial and error. So I hope this can be of help. I also take 15 mg abilify per day. If not I\u2019m afraid I will have a relapse, and then more drugs and a return of these distressing symptoms. In reply to @berit \"Glad it's working for you. Watch out for involuntary leg, arm and even head jerks and...\" + (show) HI @berit, Thanks for your post. My sister has been experiencing a lot of hand tremors since starting Abilify. She is reluctant to chalk it up to the Abilify (I just mentioned your post to her). She\u2019s more prone to blame it on stress and smoking, but she had stress and was smoking pre-Abilify. Any comments? Thanks so much. In reply to @nickjr \"I was diagnosed with tardive dyskinesia more then 16 years ago when I was taking trilafon...\" + (show)  Hi @nickjr, Glad to hear the major symptoms are at bay. Congrats on your perseverance to find things that helped. Thanks for sharing your wisdom, especially 3 months after my post\u2026you guys are all very generous and thoughtful. In reply to @berit \"Glad it's working for you. Watch out for involuntary leg, arm and even head jerks and...\" + (show) It could be a side effect of the abilify and not permanent damage like I have. Maybe ask the doctor to cut back the dose, maybe that would help. I would only take these medicines if they are absolutely needed. I also would not take them for years unless you really have to . Has she seen a neurologist? Also maybe a different med would agree with her more. Another idea with the doctors permission stop taking the abilify for about a week and see if the tremors go away. In addition drinking alcohol with these drugs can really mess a person up. Thanks again @nickjr for sharing your wisdom. My sister is so darn stubborn\u2026when I suggest these things to her, she just brushes me off. I think I\u2019ll send our posts to her daughter- she seems to be the only one that can get through to her mom. You are absolutely right\u2026no one should take anti-psychotics unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. I just spent the past year coming off Seroquel, opiates and ativan. I feel so much clearer and much more energy. It all happened at the suggestion of my lawyer after an MVA\u2026not from my GP or psychiatrist. Isn\u2019t life strange? And yet, my sis (who has witnessed my relatively easy withdrawal from all) doesn\u2019t heed my warnings. Guess I\u2019m a prophet in my own town\u2026families (sheesh:) Oh, and last thought, my sister doesn\u2019t drink at all, so I\u2019m thankful for that blessing. In reply to @sallycanuck \"Thanks again @nickjr for sharing your wisdom. My sister is so darn stubborn...when I suggest these...\" + (show)   I know your very concerned about your sister. My condition got so bad overnight that I felt like my life was lost. I felt determined to regain the life I had . I was about 45and never anticipated it. I know there were worse things but I sure wanted this one to get better! I\u2019m no doctor but I think the tremors may be a start of something and to get it checked by a neurologist right away, If they change the medicine or even reduce it or eliminate it completely maybe catching it early would help. Congratulations on getting off everything, I just think some times maybe I didn\u2019t have to take the trilafon for so many years. I know I am better so I have that to be thankful for and I\u2019m still taking the abilify, I don\u2019t want a relapse. I have a friend who was beginning to have hand tremors and they reduced his meds and it got better. In reply to @berit \"Glad it's working for you. Watch out for involuntary leg, arm and even head jerks and...\" + (show) If it is caused by Ability (and who knows? I\u2019m not a doc \u2013 I can only tell you what happened to me). If it is caused by Ability it will get worse, which is a clue is is caused by Ability and not something else. Also, what I experienced was not so much tremors as it was sudden, involuntary leg and arm jerks. They came on suddenly, when I was sitting minding my own business. One sudden jerk, then they went away until the next time, which was sometimes the next day. or the next hour. But this is the scary part. I mentioned it to my psychiatrist who said I wasn\u2019t taking anything that would cause involuntary twitches and jerking. i went to a neurologist who also drew a blank. Meanwhile, the twitches and jerks became more frequent and more of my body parts became involved, like my head. Then one day, almost a year later, I am watching TV and on comes an ad for Abilify. And in that VERY long list of possible side effects is INVOLUNTARY TWITCHES AND JERKS that can become PERMANENT. I met w/ my psychiatrist and told her I was VERY annoyed that she didn\u2019t know about this wanted off ASAP. It took several YEARS for the twitches and jerks to end completely. It is sad, but true, that we need to stay on top of own medical care b/c no one cares as much or devotes as much time to our care as we will. And yes, I have worked in health care and this is, again, the voice of experience ce speaking. It is also true that you can lead the horse to water, but you can\u2019t make him drink. Don\u2019t attempt the impossible \u2013 I hate to say it but people have the right to make what we believe is the stupid/wrong choice (and yes, again, the voice of experience \u2013 I have been so upset about this sometimes I have wanted to scream \u2013 but adults get to decide what they think is best for them, whatever our opinion might be) however hard it might be to watch them doing it. Best of luck to you and your sister. In reply to @nickjr \"I was diagnosed with tardive dyskinesia more then 16 years ago when I was taking trilafon...\" + (show)  Welcome back @nickjr.

I am happy for you that eventually you solved the riddle yourself- which is incredibly tough to do if you\u2019re depressed and are taking meds that fog your brain. Good for you!! In reply to @sallycanuck \"Thanks again @nickjr for sharing your wisdom. My sister is so darn stubborn...when I suggest these...\" + (show)   Hi @nickjr, I had a weepy moment when I read the opening line to this post. Guess I haven\u2019t been fully conscious of how much I worry about her, even though I think I\u2019m setting healthy boundaries. Hope I didn\u2019t come across as bragging about coming off meds; Lord knows that I have had to take various drug cocktails over the past twenty years to keep me alive and kicking. I understand the fear that comes with even thinking about changing meds that seem to be working. In BC Canada, where we live, the BC Medical Association introduced new rules regarding the prescribing of opiates and benzo\u2019s. A doctor can actually lose his or her licence to practice if the guidelines aren\u2019t followed. I know my doctor has many patients who are struggling with the new guidelines and feel forced to wean off meds that they just don\u2019t feel psychologically prepared for. I appreciate all the comments from everyone and send love from the Wet Coast In reply to @berit \"Glad it's working for you. Watch out for involuntary leg, arm and even head jerks and...\" + (show) I had a drinking/drug problem, which I believed triggered a temporary psychosis. I quite drinking/drugging 30 years ago. I dramatically improved. I decided to take the medications. Trilfon/Zyprexa after about 15 years I developed the tardive dyskinesia. I know what your saying, if I continue to take the abilify my symptoms will get worse. One problem is if I discontinue the lower dose of abilify and have a relapse, put into treatment, get loaded down with meds, my TD symptoms get a lot worse. So I have decided to stay with the lower dose of abilify which is not supposed to have the side effects of the older meds. I had one relapse, and my symptoms got much worse, when I was put on Geodon. I\u2019d like to get off of all meds but a relapse is to much of a possibility. Maybe I should look into natural alternatives more. I will keep what you said in mind. Maybe at some point I can get off of the abilify. What you said is why socialized medicine scares me. I believe we have the right to refuse to take the medicine. We also have the brains to research and know what is good or bad for us. I know it can be a struggle to go against doctors orders you just have to look around to find a doctor that will, I don\u2019t know sounds like they are under pressure from bureaucrats. We seem to be headed in the same direction here in the US. I\u2019ve lived in Canada and know what your saying. I\u2019ve worked out agreements with the doctors in the US and they seem to be pretty reasonable. In reply to @nickjr \"What you said is why socialized medicine scares me. I believe we have the right to...\" + (show) Even with its negatives, I\u2019m still a big fan of socialized medicine. I can access any treatment I need, at a cost of only $30/mo and our drug costs are so low. The \u201crule\u201d changes I mentioned are to combat the ever-growing problem of opiate and benzo addictions, and would have happened, I think, even in a private health care setting. But, this isn\u2019t important\u2026what is important is that you are doing okay and it sounds like this has been a very long, hard fought battle for you. I send my best wishes for health and happiness and continued healing. Well, that is good to know, I\u2019ll think about it. Is it possible to withdraw from anti-psychotic meds and hold down a job at the same time? What kinds of accommodations do employers make for such situations? A loved one took an anti-psychotic for a number of years. After significant improvement, they were tapered off of it\u2013not sure over how many weeks, and somewhere after\u2026I do not recall the exact timing, they had another episode. Now they are back on an extremely expensive prescription. This whole experience has brought up more questions than answers. There is no apparent drug use or drug or alcohol history. Since being put on the meds, there has been severe weight gain and multiple compulsive behaviors. The research indicates that over time a higher percentage of people treated for psychosis do better off of anti-psychotics. The research seems to indicate that withdrawal from anti-psychotics may precipitate psychosis. However, the hospital did not mention to extended family that the second \"episode\" may have been precipitated by withdrawal from the med rather than by the patient's condition. I feel as though our family has been held captive by a rapacious medico-pharmoceutical complex. Over 10 years we have spent down an inheritance, had our reputation marred by job loss and instability, and nearly lost hope for the future. In reply to @leda0001 \"Is it possible to withdraw from anti-psychotic meds and hold down a job at the same...\" + (show)        In addition\u2026.(continued from my previous post) Sorry for the ranting emotion, though the situation has been a struggle. The expense and perceived medical and psychological impairment of the patient by using anti-psychotic drugs in part cause me to ask these questions. However the patient does not yet have the desire to get off of the very thing that seems to be impairing relationship and career progress. The Positive On a positive note, a new psychologist has built trust and some real progress has been made over the past year; the patient's ability to have insight and to be mindful seems to be restored to some degree. Other factors including two years living with family, thus lowering the stress of housing costs and of living alone, as well as job success, have helped. Concerns Still The compulsivity associated with the medication concerns me. With the marked progress recently, compulsive set backs threaten to undo the progress toward a more fulfilling life. In addition with the patient showing no insight into the potential long-term side effects, is it the ethical choice for someone, myself or the medical team to suggest alternatives? Any experience or thoughts or suggestions are welcome. I'm glad it's helping you. When I was on it several years ago, I gained over 200 pounds. I'm now preparing for bariactric surgery in a few months. Some medicines are really the cause of weight gaining. I don't know anything bout Abilify, but I experienced suddenly weight gain after using a medicine called Mirtazapine. (It was prescribed to me because I had a really hard time sleeping at night. ( I still take it today but at a very low dosage.) The problem is that my entire life I have been slender (if not skinny!) and now I find it difficult to deal with these extra pounds. :<( @netter9064, Thank you for sharing. It must have been difficult. I wish you well and I hope everything turns out fine after your surgery. In reply to @chistiania \"Some medicines are really the cause of weight gaining. I don't know anything bout Abilify, but...\" + (show)  I didn't realize until a couple of years after I had been on Abilify that it was notorious for weight gain. I just thought it was me and my depression symptoms. I was on Mirtazapine for anxiety for a while as well until just recently. I found out that it, too, can cause weight gain. I just don't understand why these doctors would put me on a medication like that when I'm already severely obese. My current psychiatrist just prescribed me Vrylar and I discovered that it can cause weight gain, too. I haven't been taking it and I have been unable to reach him to follow up about it. I'm starting the process of getting vagus nerve stimulation. So far, medication hasn't worked for me. I've also tried ECT, TMS, Spravato and ketamine. Ketamine was a true game changer for me, however the clinic started doing it by injection and not infusion. Unfortunately it didn't have the same results. I'm going to give the vagus nerve stimulation a try. There's really nothing else for me to try at this point. I know getting the weight off will help, but I don't think it's the cure. I can imagine how difficult it is for you with the added weight. I have battled my weight all of my life. I know how I feel when I'm at a healthy weight verses a few pounds and it was challenging. Currently my situation is definitely unmanageable. Thank you for your kind words and encouragement. In reply to @netter9064 \"I didn't realize until a couple of years after I had been on Abilify that it...\" + (show) @netter9064 Hi again, netter9064! Well, do you know why some doctors and some psychiatrists do not mention that these medicines can cause a big weight gain? Sad to say, I believe it is because 1) they (or their dear ones) are NOT the ones taking these medicines. 2) Often, because of pure negligence or ignorance, they are not even aware of the side effects. 3) They (I know this is hard to take, but still) simply DO NOT care. \u2013 The reason for me saying this, is that I have noticed (on more occasions) that they give up on us patients, even before listening carefully to what we are about to say. I have experienced saying to more than one doctor that I am so sick many months in a row in the course of any given year since I, unfortunately, suffer tremendously because of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (to the extent that sometimes even making a simple phone call is a cause of huge stress and feels like having to climb Mount Everest). They listen somewhat, but after I have explained how my days are (miserable), they either say nothing or tell me that I am depressed (I bet I am! How would they be if they were so weak every single day for 6-7-8 months and they were not living but only merely surviving?) A few of these doctors have had the guts to tell me that they have never heard of these symptoms before (which is really bad :<( since I have just told them.) If they only had been a little more interested in learning something new, that they don't know or at least had owned a little curiosity (if not empathy!), they surely should have made the effort of trying listening more carefully (and afterward perhaps do some research (?) \u2013 which, of course, also would require some extra time \u2013 and time is money, so why bother?). I have even met a couple of doctors who (instead of just admitting that they know nothing about CFS) say \"You know, there are many doctors who do not believe in CFS\" (and obviously they themselves belong to the incompetent & arrogant category). This respectless behavior on their part makes me feel as if I was some sort of a charlatan who is inventing things just for the heck of it. Sorry, netter9064, this is longer than I intended. I hope I haven't taken up too much of your time. I got Tardive dyskinesia from the use of Abilify. It is an antipsychotic and I have never been psychotic. It was prescribed to me by a psychiatrist to help to make my antidepressants work better. Well now, my speech sounds like I have had a stroke and I have chronic pain in my tongue. Constant burning and discomfort. I told my psychiatrist that I was having some tongue movements and thrusting noticed by others. I told him this for over a year. HE DID NOT LISTEN TO ME! Please don\u2019t take this awful drug. It can cause very serious problems!! In reply to @chistiania \"@netter9064 Hi again, netter9064! Well, do you know why some doctors and some psychiatrists do not...\" + (show)  Hey, well I don't know for sure why.. like you I can only speculate: 1) They think (hope) that the benefits outweigh the negative. 2) They hope that it will be a side effect that we won't get. 3) They are so \"taxed\" with patients that they don't have time to read about all of the potential side effects of medication. 4) Giving them the benefit of the doubt, they are prescribing what they feel would work the best irregardless of the side effects. I have really had to be proactive about treatments and medications in recent years. However, with depression and insomnia I have let things like researching medication slide. It's hard to be motivated to research stuff, but then it comes back to bite me in the butt.. like the weight gain. Mental health and other invisible illnesses can be very challenging because we don't have a broken bone to show or \"prove\" our illnesses. As a Christian, I'm at the point that I'm just looking forward to heaven where there will be no more pain, sickness or sorrow. I am just trying to stay focused on Jesus and get through each day. I know He can heal me instantly but for whatever reason He has chosen not to so far. I try to be grateful for the health that I do have as it can always be worse. A close friend of mine has had Complex Regional Pain Syndrome for 20 years now. She is in off the chart pain 24\u00d77.. and she can't take pain meds. A lot of people in her state are on morphine drips because of the pain or they die by suicide as the pain is so horrific. There's not a cure either. So, I'm very grateful that I'm not in pain, I don't hear or see things that aren't there, I'm not homicidal. So, even though my situation is severe.. I've been on SSDI for several years, I have plenty to be thankful for. I'm not trying to minimize the pain or seriousness of our situation. It's just if it weren't for Jesus I would have been gone a long time ago. I keep reminding myself that this life is temporary, but heaven is for eternity. I will be praying for you.. restored health, peace and joy. I will also pray that in every moment, good days or bad that you would reach out to Jesus. He does love and care for you. The Bible says that He is very close to the brokenhearted. Once you feel and sense His presence.. there's nothing else like it. I don't mean to preach at you. Just wanted to share how I cope with severe depression and insomnia. I certainly understand fatigue.. though I don't have your diagnosis. It's super challenging for me to function with the little sleep I get. You're so right.. the smallest task seems impossible. Keep moving forward.. one breath at a time In reply to @chistiania \"Some medicines are really the cause of weight gaining. I don't know anything bout Abilify, but...\" + (show)  What is your dose of mirtazapine? In reply to @cmd \"What is your dose of mirtazapine?\" + (show) 15 mg 7.5 mg is usually the dosage for sleep. In reply to @netter9064 \"Hey, well I don't know for sure why.. like you I can only speculate: 1) They...\" + (show)      How long have you been on Mirtazapine In reply to @cmd \"7.5 mg is usually the dosage for sleep.\" + (show) @ cmd \u2013 Are you a doctor? Honestly, I am asking you because what the specialist gave me the first time was a higher dose. I noticed that I was terribly hungry all the time and that I had started putting on a lot of weight (which bothered me a lot since I have been slender my entire life and I found it hard to deal with this extra weight). I thought it was a strange concidence and I was the one to tell the doctor that I did not want to use it anymore because I believed Mirtazapine was the cause of my weight gain. In reply to @cmd \"How long have you been on Mirtazapine\" + (show) Oh gosh, I want to say 3-4 years. I've been on so many meds and switched back and forth it's hard to keep up. It was on the Abilify when I started packing on the pounds. Hi everyone. I've been reading a lot of these posts and most are very positive so here I go( I'm sorry if I ramble\u2026..manic right now) I've been talking to a counselor for almost 2 years, along with a psychiatrist once in a while for her just to check in. They still won't diagnose me with bipolar ADHD. At least the psychiatrist won't. My counselor tried but\u2026\u2026I was on duloxatine for a year and it just seemed like I was agitated at everything all the time. I had to stop going to most stores because people would just p\u2026 me off sooo badly. I'm a kind caring person and my family and friends asked why I was do angry all the time. I weaned off that medication and now not so angry and upset with myself anymore. However, I still get manic episodes all the time but when they end I'm so depressed I don't want to even leave my room ( I have a wonderful daughter who makes me get up and moving and I do because my love for her is overwhelming so\u2026..) I get nervous and nauseous at these times but eventually I bounce back but then it's manic time again. I have rhumatoid arthritis and it's severe in my back knees hands and feet. Just started tremfya 2 weeks ago so I'm hopeful for some relief there. I guess my big question is how do I go about getting the psychiatrist to actually listen to me?? She was a half hour late on one of our telehealth meetings and I ignored her. I was way too angry to talk to her. I asked for a different one but\u2026\u2026 I've also asked for different medications but it's all mindfulness\u2026\u2026. which I've tied, have a book on it but my brain never shuts up. There's more but I hope someone gets what I'm asking or trying to say or???????? Thanks in advance for any help. I'm so glad you are doing so well on Abilify! I have treatment resistant depression, so I must take several things in addition to Abilify. I had DNA testing to see what would likely work for me. I can honestly say I have not had any bad side effects at all. It seems to fill in the gaps of where the other meds just don't quite do the trick sometimes. Hoping for great success for you. Abilify caused me to develop Tardive dyskinesia. It is a neurological disorder. Please don\u2019t take it. It causes serious side effects. I have constant mouth and tongue burning plus my voice sounds like I had a stroke. It is awful. Others get terrible movement disorders of their necks, legs and arms. I was never psychotic. Antipsychotics, like Abilify, can cause Tardive dyskinesia. It was used to \u201caugment\u201d my antidepressants. I fired that psychiatrist. He argued with me that only 1% of the population get TD. Well I am that one out of 100. Please do your research. I trusted my doctor u til this happened. It cannot be cured. Don\u2019t take the chance!!!! All Abilify did for me was help me gain well over 250 pounds. I have Severe Treatment Resistant Major Depression and severe insomnia. So far nothing has helped.. ECT, TMS, Spravato or ketamine by injection. Ketamine infusion was a game changer, but I can't find a clinic that does the IV infusion that is covered by insurance. I'm going to have an appointment with Mayo this next week. I'm also trying to get Vagus Nerve Stimulation for depression, but I can't find a neurologist who will do it for depression, only Parkinson's. The future is very dismal. In reply to @netter9064 \"All Abilify did for me was help me gain well over 250 pounds. I have Severe...\" + (show) Dear @netter9064. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING. Everything appears to be inter-related, yet one element/concern is treated as a separate event. I finally created a chart so I could see the inter-relationship among diagnoses, medications, symptoms,side-effects, ,& meds. Something remarkable that I was able to achieve: My primary care provider, Endocrinologist & psychiatrist talked among one another:; Patient/professional partnership & Collaboration. They reviewed 2018nresults of Gensite results. Malabsorportion contributed to lack of efficacy and didn't help with Treatment Resistant Depression. I received my spravato treatment yesterday. I do feel relief of suicidal thoughts . Brand name meds help w/ variability. Yesterday, my Miller/ ? DEPRESSIVE Scale was at an all time low: 4. In 2018, my score was 60. I have had to advocate for myself and yet maintain a receptive working relationship. Our doctors are care providers. They need to listen, react accordingly, preferably be proactive rather than reactive. It is not us against them. It is focusing on Collaboration among Parents, Participants, Professionals and subsequent collaboration. My uncle had late onset Parkinsons. He shared, \"I'm not living on borrowed time. It's bonus time. \" he died 1 month short of his 90th b-day. He spent 30 years celebrating bonus time. Good luck and keep on truckin' All for now. Meds kicking it. Want to avoid sleep texting"

          " Hello NIkki, I feel sad to read through your post, its so much pain. BE strong life has always been a battle. Your blessed to have such a supportive family to keep you busy. In life there are miracles also, you have not seen the future. You will get much better. Down let yourself down, keep strong :) What a sad story. I think you may have a viable case against the GP who prescribed the drug that has caused this horrible condition. There is always some risk of tardive dyskinesia with these first generation antipsychotic medications, but the risk is significantly higher in someone with an aquired brain injury, and some studies suggest the risk is even higher in women with aquired brain injury. This is something your GP really should have been aware of. I can't believe that he wasn't aware of these issues. I know that suggesting you sue your doctor isn't going to help you. But it is something to consider. There must be support groups for people with TD, perhaps you may find some help in such a group. Recovering from a head injury is challenging enough without having to deal with this horrible disorder too. You can't do anything now about either of these outcomes. But you can do something about how you react to them. I can imagine that you are anxious and depressed. Perhaps you should see a doctor (not the one who made you ill), who can refer you for therapy that might help with the anxiety. I hope you are able to find a good doctor that you can build up some trust with. At least you haven't lost your intellectual capacity or your ability to look after yourself and your child. You have a loving supportive family. The human spirit can be amazingly resilient, it may take you some time and it may be very difficult but I'm sure in time you will adjust to your new circumstances. I know that encouraging or kind words can't assuage the anxiety and sadness you must feel, or quell the anger it would be perfectly reasonable for you to feel towards the doctor who has injured you. That power of love you feel for your daughter is a strength you can bring to bear on any problem you feel. So you must know you are an immensely powerful woman. You can overcome your fear and anxiety, you can succeed for yourself and your daughter. I wish you all the luck and love in the world, but more than that I wish you the power of your own conviction. All the very best. Always research any meds you put in your body. Many meds can cause problems if, say, you have glaucoma. Your doc isn't going to tell you all the possible interactions with other meds, foods ( did you know that with many drugs you cannot eat grapefruit or cranberries!) but you have to be proactive. When people tell you not to google this or that. That is absurd. Knowledge is power. Docs are not gods, they are people and some are more knowledgeable than others. When they tell you NOT to look up side effects, they want you to remain ignorant of something they don't want you to know. And that advice can be deadly. Feel free to blast him for that \"advice\" as it sounds like incompetence to me."

I had an adverse reaction to Gabapentin 300 mg. after only taking 2 consecutive doses. &#160; Tardive is a more gradual onset. Do you know which RX caused your movements? My facial features are a mess too. It took me quite awhile to see myself as a useful teaching aide. They called me a diagnostic dilemma, so I think it&#39;s only fair to show on my YouTube videos what they have overlooked on my brain MRI. Maybe Gabapentin doesn&#39;t cause permanent damage to everyones hypothalamus gland, but I have a 5 mm lesion on my hypothalamus gland. &#160;They tell me, &quot;That would only cause an endocrine problem,&quot; &#160;but they might have forgotten the fact that it also makes Dopamine at the Arcuate nucleus, which is right before my lesion. &#160;I found others complaining about developing twitches and jerks from Gabapentin, so I know I&#39;m not alone. &#160;Doctors really need to learn how to be more conservative in using neuroactive drugs, and never tell a patient to go off cold turkey either. It&#39;s difficult to go out in public, but I try to choose one person to speak with so they will be informed, just like I wish I had been. &#160;</p><p>&#160;</p> THE STRESS TEST**** A doctor put in my records that my movement disorder is caused by too much stress. In August, I registered to attend a Dystonia Medical Research Foundation seminar on October 20, 2018, in Gig Harbor, WA. We prefer to travel by motor home, towing a small car, so we left two days early. We crossed a bridge into Oregon. My husband didn't mention the steering had become stiffer, until he almost hit a large light pole while making a corner with a No Parking sign. He said, \"We just lost the power steering.\" Since we were blocking both one way lanes, he unhitched the car, and parked it. Meanwhile, an angry driver must have called the police, since there was a lot of honking going on. The policeman told him, \"I could give you a big citation for blocking traffic, but it's obvious you're having mechanical problems.\" The department of transportation truck arrived, and provided a bunch of Hazmat towels and led him to a parking area, in front of a restaurant. I was thinking, \"There goes our trip!\" I should have known my hubby would determine the problem, and go for parts even though he was covered with greasy transmission fluid. I called our nearest son for help, and after fixing one thing, they also found a line leaking anti-freeze. I was ready to go home. THE HECK WITH THAT SEMINAR! No, he was determined to get me there. Stay tuned for PART 2  STRESS TEST - 2 Since we were parked in front of a Bosnian restaurant, and parking overtime in a 2 hour parking zone, the owners didn't complain about our 32 foot motor home taking up their customers parking area. That night he drove us to the Astoria Maritime Museum, where we stayed over night. My husband had to drive the car home since he needed C clamps to temporarily fix the other leak, and I reminded him to take time to bathe. I wasn't afraid to stay alone at the motor home, since I read a book. We left early the following morning in foggy conditions with window defrosters that couldn't dry the windshield, since he had clamped off that hose. We went to our son's house so he could finish repairing that hose. We finally hit the road, and made it to our friend's home at 5:00 PM. We gave ourselves plenty of time to travel by car to Gig Harbor but we didn't know the GPS directions would get scrambled in heavy fog. It was trying to direct us to Spokane, but he said, \"I think it means Spokane Street.\" I said, \"Well it says arrival time is 4.5 hours, so you better try to make it recalibrate.\" It finally got us to our destination. I was a little embarrassed to walk into a crowded room since the seminar was in progress. At least I was glad to hear the first speaker say, \"Many doctors consider people with Dystonia, and other movement disorders as having a Psychogenic problem, but it's always a problem within the brain circuitry.\" I saw one lady in a wheelchair who has uncontrollable shoulder jerks similar to mine, so I introduced myself. There was a man sitting at a table near me who had head jerks similar to mine. I wanted to know if surgical denervation could possibly control my head jerks. Another doctor discussed the pros and cons of surgical intervention. She said that procedure helps for awhile, but those nerves can innervate, (grow back) and cause worse problems. They recommend Botox treatments as the safest treatment even though it might take a few times to locate the right nerves. Our trip had a few bumps, but that's life. "

          " You are on the right track I think. I heard great reviews about dgl licorice and tried it but it didn't do much for me. But maybe because I wasnt eating the right dose. It's written on the bottle to eat 6 tablets a day but I used to eat only 2 or maximum 4 sometimes. I tried the slippery elm( again great reviews about it) but I think it was too strong for me or something or maybe that my acid reflux is way too severe that I didon't see much of a change but I have been trying to make lifestyle changes by eating less and chewing my food well and eating 6 times a day. Still on dexilant 60 mg. I wish you recovery and for myself too. And yes you should slowly wean them off. Wish someone would have given me this valuable advise before. But anyways wish you healthy recovery  I mean the PPIs and H2 blockers  Just read about something called Hydrotalcite. Anyone tried this for heartburn? This appears to be the generic name. Doesn't appear to be manufactured under a trade name Well actually you have to go gradually. So you're on the right track. After those 8 weeks you were off the PPI, did you perhaps consume a trigger food? I've been on PPI for 5 years. During those years I was able to be off of them for about 9 months, which was great. At other \"good\" times I would take 3 pills a week or even less. Other times I'm back on full dose. Recently I've stopped them for two weeks, and I'm NOT symptom free. I'm thinking about surgery if I can't get off of them because in the past two months they've maid things worse I think. It doesn't mean you can't get off of them. You should continue trying but don't let the symptoms go very bad! It's like balancing on a rope when trying to wean them off. good luck  PPIs have come in for a lt of bad press. They are really very effective at doing their job - which is what can acuse problems for some. High doses of PPIs over the course of a few years may deplete the stomach of too much acid (called \"hypocchlorhydria\" ) . Stomach acid is required to leech essential minerals from food. Insufficient stomach acid can result in hypocalcaemia (insufficient calcium which can exacerbate osteoporosis and may need supplementation with calcium citrate ([i]not [/i]carbonate that just further neutralises acid)), anaemia (low iron can cause fatigue), hypomagnesaemia (low magnesium which has many effects), etc. Stomach acid also acts to control bacteria so depletion can result in bacterial infections like C-Difficile. In America, PPIs have been avaialable readily over the counter for many years. They are the best way of controlling acid[i] if taken correctly[/i]. That means the lowest effective dose for as short a period as required. Unfortunately, too many, finding they worked but \"could do better\", started taking too many for too long without medical supervision. This resulted in the FDA having to issue warnings about the possibility of PPIs resulting in bone loss, low magnesium, C-Diff etc which has given these drugs (which may be potential life savers) a bad name. They ara ctually amongst the safest drugs available and have been used for 30 years by millions of peopl worldwide. Some people need to take them for life. I, myself, took them for 15 years increaing to a very high dose (80mg omeprazole) and getting anaemic etc, before I had a fundoplication to reduce the reflux instead. The lactobacilus you're taking will help defend against harmful bacteria. The other supplements act as a demulcent soothing any inflammation and increasing mucous in the oesophagus. Many find these supplements useful but they are not effective in controlling acid. Acid + Bile + Reflux attacking the oesophagus can cause the (potentially) pre-cancerous condition, Barrett's Oesophagus. (Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma is the 5th most common casue of cancer death in the UK, EU and US.) So before you decide to stop PPIs, you should discuss this with your doctor and if yuu've been having heartburn for a while, have an endoscopy to check no permanent damage has been doe=ne to your oesophagus. Thank you for the advice, even though its a bit depressing! Cant help thinking I shouldnt be taking a PPI drug and an H2 blocker. Dont they work against each other? I am seeing a homeopathic doctor too, for help but its too soon to tell if the medication is having any effect. I havent alway suffered from this so surely I can get back to where I was ie. short flare ups of heartburn every year or so, lasting no more than a week? Ive read about the theory that heartburn is caused by too little acid, in which case these pills are doing more harm than good. My doctor thinks this is a flawed theory, however. There seems to be so many contradictory theories around this horrible illness that so many people suffer with that its about time someone came up with facts. My medication makes me feel tired and down hearted so I really need to seek alternatives. Hillary have you ever thought about alkaline water, enzymes, slippery elm, apple cider vinegar. There just are dozens of options. Lots of good info on JPT's Facebook page (very long page!)"

          " Hi Summer, I have suffered from Chronic Generalised Dystonia since an accident in my early twenties. I know exactly what you are going through, it is like fighting a losing battle with your own body. Are you any taking dopamine receptor blockers like antipsychotic medications at all? These can cause the Tardive Dystonia to become worse and not better. I am on many medications for dystonia, Madopar which is used to slow involuntary movements down. You must be weaned on to them, because of how much your body can take. Another medication that does work wonders for around 6-8 weeks at a time is Botulinum toxin (BoTox). This is administered by a Neurologist Consultant because of certain side-effects that it can cause if injected wrong. I have 6 injections every 10 weeks, in my neck muscles to calm down the neck spasms. I am sorry to say there is no cure for any type of Dystonia - I have lived with it for over 30 years now, and it can become progressively worse over time. I also take Orphendrine via an oral liquid, it used to be available in tablet form, but production was stopped and Neurologists were trying to find a close alternative. I done my own research because I ended up in hospital after the tablet form was stopped suddenly, and all other medications that were tried failed. I found there was an oral version of Orphendrine so I informed my neurologist and I was prescribed it within a day, by which time I could not even pick up anything at all. I hope this helps you out to a degree, I have studied Neurology to an extent on medication on brain activity and involuntary movements. Regards, SteV3. Summer and Steve, Steve sounds quite knowledgeable about this. Summer your problems are even worse than mine. Mine started as Tardive Dyskinesia (mostly the mouth and jaw). It was caused by Geodone, Seroquel ..... supossedly newer, safer anti-psychotics --- no, I'm not psychotic at all, but doctor used it on my bi-polar depression. That was nearly 10 years ago; Now the distonia has moved into my neck and hands. The near-constant movements eventually damage muscle and nerves. I suffer horrible neck and arm pain, daily. I've seen so many doctors. Not fond of them, either; they can't help or don't even understand it. I am trying Botox .... just a muscle relaxant (helps with depression too). That will be in December. I've considered every ailment know to man .... well, exagerated there. Balcofen doesn't do much. Be careful of such meds -- category Anti-cholinergics. Too much of them causes symptoms of dementia!! really. Pain pills don't work either. Lying down for hours helps. You started this with a nausea med? name of it? How are you now? I decided to not sue. Hope to hear from both of you. Kris "

          " Hi Paula, I was diagnosed as having Fibromyalgia some years ago and have many of the signs and symptoms you mention, and others. I used to be on pain killers and suffered the side effects so eventually decided to come off those and feel better for it. It is a horrible condition but I use mind conditioning to overcome many problems, that is to say, accepting the situation and then focusing away from the pain. Oh its there all right but I just dont let it bother me. I tried CBD oil but made no difference just lightened my bank account. Having said that my friend who suggested it to me, also a fellow sufferer, she took CBD and became pain free, she said. I think sometimes accepting things are as they are can help win through many problems in this life. Is that too Stoic? well if it is it works for me. I do hope you are able to find a way to manage your difficulties. I do have another way I cope that helps me win through, but maybe thats for another time. Take care now and dont overdo things. My kind regards, Dave. Antidepressants can make you grind your teeth and move your jaw around, sometimes just when you sleep, other times when you are awake. This can put pressure on your temples, neck, jaw and your shoulder blade, often people describe a crunchy sensation. Antidepressants can also give you acid reflux too. The lumps could be bursitis. If you are having brain fog and you are twitching and having tingling sensation, I would recommend seeing a neurologist. Have you heard of tardive dyskinesia? That is a possibility. If you are jerking your legs, that could be causing your lower back pain. Are you taking vitamin d or any other vitamins? It is very important after the menopause to take certain vitamins. If you are deficient in certain vitamins it can give you depression and anxiety or definitely make it worse. Hello Paula my name is Luis and I was reading your symptoms and I can related to some of your symptoms and I know how you feel about it well my are cause by mold but every doctor I have been to can't figure it out and is very frustrated I wish I can help you out with your health problem Im "

But&#160;[b]please&#160;[/b]don&#39;t stop or even reduce the antipsychotics without strict medical supervision, as this can cause major problems.</p><p></p><p>Both antipsychotics and antidepressants - but particularly the former - can cause mental slowing. You&#39;re clearly reacting badly to your antipsychotic meds if you&#39;re getting tardive dyskinesia. I know what this can be like as I saw a dear friend going through it when she was put on clozapine. Medications affect different people in different ways, and there are many other antipsychotics which might not cause the same disastrous side-effects.</p><p></p><p>I&#39;m very glad to hear that your GP has referred you to a neurologist. That&#39;s the specialist you need to see.</p><p></p><p>But I&#39;m still flummoxed about the antipsychotics. It&#39;s true that some people go through mental changes in the immediate aftermath of a head injury (or indeed brain surgery - which is a type of injury in itself). Antidepressants or anti-anxiety meds may be necessary to control this, at least in the early stages. However, it&#39;s very rare for post-head-injury patients to be put on antipsychotics. Can you tell me who prescribed these drugs, and whether they&#39;re being regularly reviewed? They should only be prescribed by a psychiatrist, but far too many GPs are getting in on the act these days, without having the necessary knowledge. That&#39;s what happened to my friend, with disastrous consequences.</p><p></p><p>The next question that comes to mind is: why are you on antipsychotics? Did you have a full-blown psychotic episode when recovering from the head injury? That&#39;s quite rare, but can happen. However, it&#39;s not common to treat this kind of episode with antipsychotics, and certainly not long-term.</p><p></p><p>You also mention epilepsy. Has the head injury left you with epilepsy? That&#39;s not uncommon, I&#39;m afraid. However, even if it did, I don&#39;t think the epilepsy would be the cause of your brain fog. It would be more likely that both are the result of the head injury itself.</p><p></p><p>I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m asking too many questions, but it seems to me that these might be questions your GP should have asked, and perhaps didn&#39;t. There isn&#39;t really enough information in your post to shell all this out.</p><p></p><p>You don&#39;t have to answer, of course. I&#39;m no authority, just some old dame on a patient forum! But it might help to formulate some of the questions you need to ask the neurologist when you get there. If you don&#39;t want to answer in public, you can send me a private message by clicking on that little envelope icon underneath my avatar. PMs via this site don&#39;t carry viruses, and they don&#39;t expose the email address of either party.</p><p></p><p>And once again, please don&#39;t stop or reduce any of your medications, particularly the antipsychotic. This has to be done over a very long period, and only under medical supervision.</p>"
