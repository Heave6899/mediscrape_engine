          " Hi Anxious Alex I am in the same position. Suffered for 2 years and getting worse. Diagnosed with HH on endoscopy (which mysteriously disappeared on barium swallow). No reflux showed up. Couldn't manage the 24 hr pH test as I gagged too much. I have a great consultant but he refuses to operate as the tests do not show anything abnormal (ha!). I can hardly sleep as I feel my stomach is under my ribs and pressing on everything. Can't breathe most of the time and quite frankly I have had enough. I tried to back up my claim by paying for Pepsin testing (~\u00a360). It was off the scale. (scary). Hope they will listen now. I have been in touch with a private clinic to get this fixed using the magnetic beads (I might have to sell all my possesions but I can't go on much longer) NO ONE SEEMS TO LISTEN Moonbuggy, you have my sympathy. I truly understand and empathise when you say you cant go on much longer. No, the manometry/PH study aren't pleasant. I just found a point on the wall to focus on, concentrated on breathing and somehow got through it. Has anyone anyone anyone had a similar experience with the PH testing, especially when bile is the suspectedculprit? Can anyone explain what the readings/levels on my monitor were? Hi Alex. The problem with LPR is the Pepsin (this is what does the damage). This is active at pH 6.5 which is much higher than normal pH of acid reflux. I have read somewhere that you can have normal readings and still have reflux (bit of a waste of time then) Hi Moonbuggy There are several other threads on here that go in to pepsin etc (one of which I started - https://patient.info/forums/discuss/lpr-silent-reflux-desperately-in-need-of-a-miracle-has-anyone-recovered-from-this--38289 ) and you will find lots of people sharing thoughts and experiences about many diverse aspects of and approaches to LPR, including pepsin damage and pepsin tests. It's mentioned frequently in that thread. Alternatively, you could start a thread yourself to get comments addressing your particular concerns. That way you will get more specific responses than you will under the heading of this discussion. I'd really like this thread not to stray away from the topics of of bile reflux and 24 hour pH testing as those are my specific questions at this moment and other aspects are well covered in other discussions. Best wishes Alex Hi Alex and thank you for the private mail earlier. I keep a record of my expectoration's. I record mainly the amount and sometimes when it merits, I will record the stickiness/or not of the mucus. I will also record what I had eaten before I see seeing something to record. I found that I had more coughing generally when I had tonsil stones but now that my tonsils have gone, I must admit the cough I produce is less but still significant. The point is that I also had pH manometry last year and your post prompted me to check on the amount of mucus production. I found that I had mucus production but much less compared to day before and the day after. In fact the lowest reading over a 2 week comparison. Wow, well that may be significant. Perhaps the gag reflex was exercised more when the tube was inserted. Another mention on this subject is that strangely enough I have a neighbour who \"was\" also suffering the conditions we speak about on the forum and we used to compare our own personal stories and notes over a perhaps 2 year period. Then one day she went for an endoscope and miraculously stopped her coughing and regurgitation immediately after. She regurgitated her food as well as mucus. I never have any issue with food. Her theory is that there was probably something corrected with the endoscope procedure. Her doctors were amazed but did not explain the relieving result. I have also written in on another discussion relating my own issues. I had an endoscope and a CT scan of my sinuses and throat last Tuesday and have already received a simple report from the GI. I am due to see him in 2 days for a fuller consultation. I will report what he relays to me. From the simple report I gather I have grade 2 oesophagitis and mild gastitis of the antrum. No Hiatus Hernia (I was told had had HH way back in 2009 - but I have been dropping down on my heels upon waking and drinking about 1 to 1.5 litres of alkaline ater. Did that fix it? Was it an incorrect diagnosis in 2009 or even in my short report I received from last weeks endoscope??) Too may questions and not enough answers. I never had any proper diagnosis of my manometry but still hold the result so will take that to my GI next week and see if I can get more of an explanation. I was simply told that I had significant reflux. Adversely, I was told following my barium swallow that I did not have reflus in 2012 and that I did in 2011. I also refused to have the 2012 barium swallow on the original day of the appointment as just like you, sods law prevailed and on the morning of the procedure I felt completely cough free. When I did have it a week later, I recall that I was congested with mucus but the result showed no reflux. I can't figure it out. Docs simply rub their heads or play with their beards. Another thing to report is that I also had a consultation with my ENT doc and asked him to give me a scope which he explained only takes the view to the voice box from the nostril. He found significant mucus which he said explained my ear aches and echo of my own voice and another probe in my ear to confirm fluid in my ears. Consequently. he prescribed Clatrithromycin 500 mgs twice a day for 10 days and Otrivine (avaliable over the counter) for maximum of the 10 days to avoid the danger of my sinuses getting used to it. And then he sent me for a CT scan for my sinuses and I requested that they scanned down to my throat level as the problem is there also. One call from the radiologist to my ENT secured the further test. I will be seeing him once I complete my antibiotics which by the way have been clearing my ears. Oh, another discovery he made was that I had one (not both) inflamed lingual tonsil. I have related this on my other post but is that sheer bad luck or symptomatic having just undergone a tonsillectomy of my palatine tonsils just 4 months ago. Is it also telling that my tonsillectomy procedure was complicated because the tonsils were stuck to my throat. I wondered if it the corrosive nature of the acids? bile? refluxing. I have managed to step up my tests and consultations because I have private cover but the truth is that I have not felt that I am able to go back to work since having completed a contract role last May and I am desperate to get better so I can perform well in my next role. My firm favourite reducer of the mucus is liquorice tea, not DGL and not even the sweets which I enjoy eating for the pleasure if noth therapeutically. Anyway, I bought a glut of the stuff. Still continuing to drink the pH water. Results are too erratic to conclude on but I have definitely been getting some relief compared to say a year ago. I've lived with this since 2006. I am tired and will not accept there is no answer. I wish I had a miraculous recovery like my neighbour but it seems there is some damage after all to my oesophagus and now I have to work out with hints and tips from you guys and my docs. What I find is interesting is how many people report their issues commencing after a flue or something similar and following taking antibiotics. I said as much to my GI doc who said he'd like to read this forum and asked him if it could be candida in the throat. He said possible and that he will check for that during my endoscope. The short report does not tell me anything more on that and I will pick up that thread when I see him and report back here. I have been increasingly thinking that I shall get one of my geeky chums to draw up a simple database for us all to complete with respect to our symptoms, anecdotes on what helps, what tests show etc. What do you guys think. We can then invite doctors, perhaps even pharmaceutical companies (don't shoot me), twho may be interested if we can push them in the symptom free direction - I happen to know a chemist who works for one of the giants to consider if the giant may put some funding together for looking into this mysterious disease that is baffling us all. Your thoughts welcome. Another idea I have may be to take myself off to an ayurvedic clinic in India that treats gastric problems with near starvation and parasitic removal procedures and then re-boot the stomach with goodness and probiotics. But that takes weeks of therapy and I want a fast track solution. Good luck Alex with your next steps and it is heartening to know we support each other on this forum to take the time to relay or ask relevant questions. Best wishes also to all the soldiers out there looking for answers. We are an erudite bunch and I am sure we will get results by sharing our stories.  Hi Alex, so sorry to hear you are also suffering from this awful condition I had the p h monitoring and it came back completely normal! I was so Frustrated and deflated that was 21/2 years ago and I'm still suffering On a daily basis!, I can only suggest that you really have to be Totally adamant that you cannot carry on like this any more. I'm off To see a top specialist soon because my voice box has been affected By all the symptoms, exactly the same ones as you. My life is a constant Struggle but I'm going to keep going back until I get some answers and hopefully Some miracle cure, I have tried all the treatments out there, nothing works. So many things seem to irritate this condition. Bending lifting sitting Everyday activities. I will keep you posted. Please be reassured it's Nothing sinister. I have had two MRI scans neck/ Brain and they came back normal. It's the awful pain and uncomfortableness and strange feelings that's so scary Some days it's unbearable, I get worried over the long term damage , on the outside you look fine. Take care Alex, I'm very concerned that you say that you will not be able to go on much longer. What do you mean by that? Are you having suicidal thoughts? Hi Sourtongue. The frustrating thing is how bad my symptoms were before the catheter went in and as soon as it came out again. It was just during the test itself that I was symptom free so I can't help wondering if the presence if the catheter somehow impedes the reflux. I dont know what the readings on display meant but, as it's bile reflux my GI was looking for (which showed on endoscopy) I'm praying that the amount of time I spent bobbing up into the mid 7s and occasionally higher will be evidence enough. In the meantime, i think I'm going to be very anxious until I see my GI again, which won't be for at least four weeks. I've read so many times about others who have had their one day, their one shot, to be assessed and having had a good day, are then told they're normal. I've had two years of failed referrals, treatments, therapies etc and it all rests on this now. My life is utterly miserable, my job has become a daily round of tears and frustration, as well as the worry of not being able to do it any longer. I don't want to still be in this position another two years down the line. I've been on antidepressants since December as by then I was already finding it hard to be positive or to cope with the symptoms. I'm sitting here now, gurgling and mucousy, my sinuses flooded and painful, coughing and clearing all the time and wondering why the hell it stopped on the only day I didn't wish for it! I guess I was just hoping to hear from someone with the same type of reflux (bile) who'd had a similar experience on the monitoring, who could tell me that my readings will prove what they need to. Wishful thinking. Anyone? Rickey, that's not really a suicidal statement, more just an expression of absolute desperation. That said, I have had many days when I have thought about suicide or, at least, gone to sleep praying I wouldn't wake up. And I know from speaking to others that I'm not alone in being driven to such thoughts by this illness. But no, it was not a statement of intent. I just can't envisage how my life can continue like this. I'm on antidepressants, entirely because of this illness. My GP and GI are aware it's having an impact on my mental and emotional wellbeing. How much remains to be seen! Alex, first of all I'm very relieved to hear that you are not considering that anymore! I have had LPR myself for over a year but wasn't diagnosed until last Sept. I can relate to you in many ways as far as the anxiety, depression, defeated thoughts and despair. I was living in major fear of LPR and what it was doing to me. I have been doing much better as of late. I had the monametry, upper GI, and Cat scan. Everything came back normal. That was in December. I had been on protonix for six months. I decided (through God's grace) I was not going to let this LPR control my life anymore. I attribute that to my faith in Jesus Christ and some biblical counseling. I am at peace with this state  currently and have decided not to undergo any more tests for now. I know on my part there are things that I have to do in order to help my body and heal. This all has shown me that I'm not in control of much of anything except what I choose to put in my mouth and how I respond to it in hope rather than fear. What is one thing that you are having the most difficult time with? I believe God is aware of your pain and suffering and will not leave you helpless and alone to suffer it meaninglessly.  Rickey, bile reflux tends not to respond to lifestyle and dietary changes the way that acid reflux does, hence I have had no joy from anything I've tried in two years, nor acid suppressant drugs. And I most certainly will never take any of those again, as I need the acid to lower the ph caused by bile. This now explains why, contrary to the accepted school of thought on reflux, I feel significantly better after drinking wine. I tried it when I had the monitor on to see if I was right and, sure enough, down came my ph to an acceptable 6 ish while I sipped a glass of Pinot Grigio blush. I'm glad you have comfort from your faith. However. I'm not a believer in god - each to their own; I have my beliefs as you have yours. But, as I say, I'm glad your faith is of comfort to you."

          "Hi I have had two years of absolute misery, not just physical but also the despair and misery that accompanies any kind of reflux. Long story short (as I have posted details elsewhere in this forum), my symptoms are mostly the LPR kind - little heartburn, mostly respiratory; coughing, wheezing, sore throat, earache, sinus/nasal problems. My journey has taken me from GP to ENT/Endo/Gastro and round the block many times. Failed PPI, ranitidine, diet etc. All the usuals. Eventually, an endoscopy in November showed hiatal hernia and significant bile reflux. GI then sent me for manometry/24 hour PH monitoring with a view to having fundoplication. Not an easily undertaken option but when you get desperate enough, yes, you want it. So, I just had the PH test and, sods law, I was practically symptom free from the moment the catheter went in, and the coughing and regurgitation returned within an hour of the tube being removed! I feel absolutely devastated that this test may not show what I usually feel, and that this long journey will be no further on. The monitor was a Sandhill Sleuth and was set for two PH readings, one of which remained mostly between 1.5 and 2.0, the other mostly around 7.2 with regular peaks well above that but some at around 6.8 My concern is that the higher readings would presumably be the bile reflux so I hope there are enough above 7 to prove that, despite the lack of usual symptoms. I can only guess that the other reading must have been in my stomach. I didn't realise they did that but how else could that reading be constantly low PH? Has anyone else had their symptoms just disappear on the day of the test? Is this common? I am so upset that my 'day' was atypical and am very worried that my care/treatment plan may be discontinued now. I am to make an appointment directly with my very nice GI; results in about 4 weeks. I know I will not be able to go on much longer if my test results don't show what I normally experience and this route is then denied me."

          " Sorry for the typos. Predictive text strikes again! I can totally agree with everything you say about the procedure. I had it done last year and was absolutely dreading it. I thought I would be heaving and retching after reading some of the comments from people so I practiced putting my fingers down my throat to get me past the gag reflex. On the day I was really scared but when I went in the doctor and nurses were very calm, I had it all explained to me, I had the spray (didn't like the taste) the shield in my mouth, the scope was slowly passed down with me swallowing and keeping calm (surprisingly) I didn't feel it after it had gone down and I was able to see the screen and what the doctor saw. He took a couple of biopsies and then slowly drew it out. I gagged once but that was it. I hadn't gone for sedation as my husband and I were going away for the weekend straight after. A man who had the sedation was rather annoyed because he had to wait an hour before he could leave while I had a quick cup of tea and then left, much better. I was surprised how calm I was considering what I had been like before the event and even the doctor was impressed and said that I was so calm he wished he had done a video so that he could show his nervous patients! For anyone who is going to have the procedure, I would advise not to take much notice of the doom and gloom messages as you may not experience anything like they describe. The most extreme one I read was that a woman felt that she had been \"violated\", a bit of an exaggeration I think. It wasn't half as bad as I thought it was going to be and was over in less than five minutes. Hi David, Many thanks for your vote of confidence. I am due to have a gastrocopy done in a few days time and I am terrified! I was due to have one done a few weeks ago but didn't have the nerves to go thought with it and I am sweating about this one just at the thought of it! I am glad to hear that yours went well. Its just the thought of not being able to breath fully and the heaving/gagging feeling it doesn't excite me at all! I have opted for sedation so I hope that this will help me! Thanks, Amanda.  Hi Amanda, Glad to have helped reassure you. Don't worry about breathing as you will be able to breathe as well as you are doing now, through your nose and/or mouth. I concentrated on my breathing and this took my mind off the procedure and made me very relaxed and sleepy. I know it's easy to say but there are really no benefits to getting yourself worked up and stressed out beforehand. If you are relaxed things will probably go more smoothly and quickly. As for the gagging, I think I may have just done a very small cough/gag right at the end when the camera came out, but it's normal and nothing to worry about. Remember there is no pain. It turned out I had severe oesophagitis after suffering acid reflux for years and will need another gastroscopy in 2 months, but I felt no pain at all despite everything being red and inflamed. I would much rather have this process than having a wisdom tooth out or a difficult filling. As you are having sedation you will probably find things even easier than me. Good luck but, just remember it will feel very strange for a matter of minutes, then it's all over and you are immediately on your way to controlling or curing what is causing your reflux.  No problem Amanda, Sorry you are having such problems with eating. What suprised me was that a diagnosis was made there and then (apart from any extra information from the biopsies), so you instantly know what is going on. In my mind, this is half the battle won. The worst part for me was coming off the omeprazole for two weeks before the gastroscopy, but I managed OK on a little bicarbonate of soda in water and Peptac (found cheaply online), also a little lemon juice in water helped if the heartburn/reflux worsened. I also worried about not being able to drink much water in the hours before the procedure as I tend to drink a lot, but it was fine in the end. Like anything the fear of the unknown and the knowledge that you are going to experience a strange feeling are worrying, but if someone like me who is scared of all things medical, including hospitals, can cope very well, then I am sure you can. Just see it as the final step to starting to get well and back to normal again! Yes you were right and nothing to worry about, have just arrived back from Blackpool hospital, staff kind and caring and like you throat spray and straight down the throat without any problems and have just had lunch no sore throat and do wish had not read the scary remarks about this procedure as it was a doddle. My tip is just relax and it will go down a dream."

          "Hello, Having been helped by reading comments on here prior to my gastroscopy today, I felt I should add my contribution. As a background, I don't like hospitals or the thought of any medical procedures at all, however my heartburn was affecting me every day and I needed to bite the bullet. All nurses and the doctor were lovely and calm and friendly. After my assessment I was taken into the room, met the doctor and was administered the throat spray. I thought it was similar to the chloroseptic spray used for sore throats but much stronger and fast acting. I then lay on my side and the scooe was placed in my mouth and Teheran doctor said I would feel it on my to the, which I think I did, just. I don't remember if the doctor asked me to swallow or not but it passed painlessly down my throat. I was able to breathe normally and swallowed a few times but throughout soneone was auctioning to remove excess saliva. I had about 7 or 8 biopsies taken and only vaguely felt a couple of them but compared to the pain of heartburn they were nothing, not even a twinge. I did feel a couple of times that I wanted the tube out of my mouth soon, but I just closed my eyes and breathed deeply and it wasn't a problem. i had no after effects at all, not even a mildly sore throat, and have ben eating and drinking normally since an hour after the procedure started. if I can do without sedation, anyone can. Please don't read all the scare stories on the internet. If you buy a fridge from Amazon, the people who will leave comments will be those who are not happy or who are delighted with the product, Not many people will bother to leave a neutral comment. Be brave for 5 or 10 minutes and you will see that it's not worth worrying too much about! Everyone is on your side."

          " <p>WOW, you deserve my congratulations and respect for all you have done. ;-)&#160; Now, I believe you did not mention you removed dairy from your diet, right? Or I miss it. ;-(&#160; If not, I suggest you do for a few weeks.&#160; Shakes do create bubbles (gas), so if you use a blender give it a few minutes before you start drinking it .&#160; Plus, you might be using dairy which could be one of the problems. Yes, sleeping on the left side does help control reflux and sleeping on the right helps the heart. Wedge pillow is still your best if you can&#39;t sleep on the left side.&#160; You can also have some Gaviscon advance or manuka honey before going to bed which helps.

          "<p>First off, I have gallstones and liver issues (elevated enzymes but no specific diagnosis), and I don&#39;t know if these conditions are affecting what I&#39;m currently going through or not. I am a 29-year-old male, smoker, don&#39;t drink, slightly overweight.</p><p></p><p>About a year ago, I woke up one morning with a severe sore throat. Despite being a smoker, I almost never have a sore throat, so I assumed I had a cold. I had also just had dental work, so I thought maybe that had something to do with it. After a week, the sore throat was still there, but no further symptoms. And so my nightmare began.</p><p></p><p>I also noticed a taste in my mouth, sometimes sweet, sometimes metallic, and some degree of difficulty swallowing (mostly just an increased awareness of the swallowing process). After researching it (and due to my phobia and mild aversion of doctors), I concluded I had silent reflux. I tried taking Tums, and things got weird.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the pain in my throat were pushed downward. Now, I was feeling a burning pain in my back (right below the left shoulder blade) and in &#160;the stomach. My stomach also felt bloated and swollen like a balloon (my stomach, not my abdomen). In the coming months, I would add lump in the throat, excessive mucous, shortness of breath, post-nasal drip, and several other odd symptoms to my list.</p><p></p><p>Fast forward a year. I quit smoking. Lost weight. Cleaned up my few remaining bad habits--and in the process extinguished whatever joy I ever got from life. I eat like a rabbit and drink only water. And my issues still remain.</p><p></p><p>I took a course of Prilosec that actually got rid of some of the symptoms--that and a wedge pillow. The postnasal drip, lump in throat, and mucous are all, blessedly, gone. But the sore throat and back persist.</p><p></p><p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping some of you can shed light on. When I sleep on my left side, the pain in back gets much worse--but I wake up with no taste of acid and no sore throat. When I sleep on the right side, the opposite. Relief &#160;from pain in back, but sore throat and taste of acid (it&#39;s always the left side of throat, by the way). Now, I&#39;ve read that left side sleeping keeps acid out of the esophagus--and the taste of acid on right side supports this--but what the hell is hurting when I sleep on my left side? Could it be my stomach? Also, when the back pain is bad, it hurts somewhat to swallow--I can feel the food, or even drink, going over that spot below my left shoulder blade, and there is a twinge of pain. (Absurdly, it feels like my LES itself is having pain when it opens to allow food through. I have the same pain when I burp--I feel the gas build at this exact spot, then relief after I burp).</p><p></p><p>This swallowing back pain goes away if I consistently sleep on my right side. But one night of left side sleeping. . . This happened a few nights ago, and I woke up in fairly unpleasant pain. It&#39;s like reopening a wound. Every few weeks, tired of the throat discomfort, I&#39;ll get dumb and try left sleeping again. I&#39;ll wake up with a mercifully clear throat--and the unmanageable back pain.</p><p></p><p>I know I need to see a doctor. I have an appointment scheduled. But in my country, doctors and the medical establishment don&#39;t look kindly on people who aren&#39;t rich. I was told before, when I mentioned some chest pain I was having (this was well before my current symptoms), that I probably had GERD. That&#39;s it. No explanation, no prescription, no guidelines. And I&#39;ll probably have to raise a fit this time to even see a&#160;gastroenterologist. So I have little hope of being helped by anyone but myself and any of you who might have had similar experiences.</p><p></p><p>Here is what I&#39;ve tried: Prilosec, Nexium, Tums, Gaviscon, baking soda, Lily of the Valley potion from Amazon, two different wedge pillows, daily 45 minute walk, ZERO acids in my diet (bland as bland can be) severe reduction of sugars and fats (already was on a low fat diet from gallstones), nothing to eat for at least 4 hours before sleeping, small meals, no caffeine (or any of the other common triggers), no smoking, no drinking, no drugs (a multivitamin that I&#39;ve tried discontinuing but it doesn&#39;t seem to help or hurt). Switched my toothpaste and floss from mint to cinnamon. I try not to stress, but after quitting smoking I&#39;m a ball of nerves and anxiety and no meditation in the world is lessening that.</p><p></p><p>I also seem to have an issue with protein. I&#39;ve tried protein powder shakes as a method of getting protein--since my low fat diet make this difficult. These shakes make me feel extremely bloated and full for hours afterward--like my body can&#39;t process them. They are plant-based, not whey, and I drink them slowly, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to anyone who reads this and has any help or info or suggestions to impart.</p><p></p><p>One last thing, I know I did this to myself. Because of my elevated liver enzymes last year, I looked up things that healed the liver. The list, for anyone who cares to Google it, is almost verbatim the triggers of acid reflux. Very depressed, feel stupid and hopeless.</p>"

          " Dear Anita, Please do try to stay calm about this. I know it is difficult in the extreme. Anxiety can play havoc as well with your digestive systems. Try some Gaviscon Advance for the moucus. It helped me enormously when I had a bout of it. A matter of days and it was gone. I can't help you with the swallowing issue or the sertnum pain. The endoscopy will tell that tale. If they had reason to suspect you for cancer - and I'm not saying that they do - but IF THEY DID - and your family history may put you in that category - you will get an endoscopy within two weeks rather than the boundary of 18 weeks which the rest of us have to wait for. All best wishes at this difficult time, Anita.  I want to share my Story with you , I like you was treated for heartburn Etc for months, 4 months to be exact, I started with some discomfort in the throat, the it went to burning in the roof of my mouth the back of my tongue etc, UNBEARABLE pain. In those 4 months I went to DR after DR 13 doctors to be exact , they all treated me for Acid Reflux. One night it got so bad it felt like the lump in my throat was going to close up my throat. I Went to ER and again he kinda was blowing it off as Acid reflux because all my blood work etc came back good , My throat was not red by just opening up and saying Ahhhh..... Then a second DR came in because i was giving such a fuss Crying etc.... He said What exactly is going On i flat out told him SOMETHING is in my throat . Everyone is saying there isnt but THERE IS! he said show me where it hurts exactly I told him all the places it hurt But the bottom of my throat is where the worst pain was . He said lets do another catscan( To shut me up) I had one 4 months prior. He came back in and said YOU DO HAVE something in your throat you have a MASS. I Said THANK GOD he said No that isnt good I said , Yes it is you found it I already knew it was there. The ENT came in and was going to do a biopsy of the \"mass\" Which ended up actually being a Abscess that had Gotten so big from being undetected. They said The Ct scan i had 4 months prior had shown it as well it just was smaller. I wrote you to say Sometimes we can be treated for things that is not really wrong with us. My body had adapted to the infection and was not showing signs of infection which in fact was a HUGE Abscess that took 15 needles to drain out. And I am fine today. Hold your head up and try to tell yourself stay calm to it gets resolved. I wish you the best DONT GIVE UP on the right DR Hi Anita i had the burning and discomfort in my sternum for weeks. It used to come and go but when i had it, it stayed for ages. I missed work often and felt so sick with it. I saw my doctor lots and ended up in A & E because i was so worried and my doctor didn't know what it was. Now i no longer have the sternum pain but have silent reflux which i am controlling but i assume it turned into this. I really think this is what u have too and it can be sorted out. You need to raise the head of your bed to start with and change your diet. You wont feel better overnight, it takes time but there is a lot of good advice in this forum so read it all through and research acid reflux diet on the net. Take care  I have the same feeling in my throat. I also take 60 mg of omeprazole. if i kinda rub my finger over my lower throat it feels sore. It feels like I'm swollowing a rock every time I swollow I am scared as well.  Hi. I too am having acid reflux problems. It started with bad heartburn but that is now under control with the help of omeprazole. However, I am also getting the lump in the throat feeling with a white coating on my tongue. I am unable to eat because of this and am having mainly liquids. Im trying some meal replacement shakes this week for some energy! I have been to my dr who has eventually referred me for an endoscopy. Are you any better now and is there anything you can recommend that helps? Thanks. Hi Anita, Thanks for getting back to me. Did you find that Lansoprazole helped you at first. I wasn't sure to start trying that instead incase it might work better than Omeprzole, although they both might be quite simlar in what they do. I am back in with my dr on Friday so will see what he suggests. I am not looking forward to having and endoscopy done but would like peace of mind and to try and get to the bottom of this. I am missing eating solid food. Are you able to eat ok with your lump in the throat feeling, has it got any better or worse for you over time and do you know of anything that we can do to help it? I know it can take time to get these kind of things under control but it is so frustrating and changes your quality of life! Thanks for your help.   Hi Anita, Thanks again for getting back to me. I know it can take time, its just the not eating that is getting to me a bit now and its my birthday on Friday so I will be gutted to not be able to have any cake and a glass of wine ha, ha! I haven't even tried alcohol yet as I heard it can make it all worse, until I am bit better anyway. I started having these problems at the end of November when I had taken some un-coated steriods that upset my stomach and started with bad heartburn after then and this caused the lump in the throat feeling too which is such a pain! Do you know what actually causes the lump feeling, is it becuase the acid comes back up into your throat? I have had a colonoscopy a few times with sedation so that has made me feel better about it thank you. I will definitley being having sedation with this one too! I guess most of it is trial and error with food. I think that if I could sort this lump in my throat feeling out I would be able to eat better and that would make me feel better. I have had a slimfast shake today which has really filled me up so that is good I have also tried one boiled sweet just to taste something nice and will see how i get on. I wish now that I had never has those tablets because they have caused all of this. What started your problems off? Thank you.  Hi Anita, I think mine was the tablets which I regret now that I took, but I was ill at the time so you just take whatn is given you to make you better. I am nearly 36 so I don't think it would be anything else. At least you have been able to have treats over Xmas time. I haven't touched any chocolates as I don't want anything to make it worse. I have lost weight through this though so that it the only good thing that has come out of it, as I was overweight and they say if you are overweight that doesn't help acid reflux either! I too have to have a colonoscopy every five years due to having cancer of the bowel in the family, as you say its not nice but I would rather be checked and kept and eye on than anything horrid happening! I will try the chewing gum, thank you. Are you staying on this forum, if you are am I ok to keep in touch with you with any further queries or help or updates as I would like to know you are getting on. Hope that it all goes well for you.

I am still having acid coming up and have a sore tongue most days burning of the lips and roof of the mouh. I have discomfort/ burning in the sternum and below the sternum and feel nauseus on and off during the day. I went back to the doctors yesterday and told him that certain foods are now feeling like they get stuck in my throat and it feels like I have something stuck in my throat all the time. When I swallow I am swallowing something down all the time. He has referred me to have an endoscopy but am so worried as my gran died from stomach cancer. Has anyone had acid reflux and these sypmtoms and given some medicine to help them as the lansoprazole doesn't seem to help the acid."

          " I have not suffered any of the symptoms you have but it sounds quite frightening. I was diagnosed with achalasia 4 years ago but the symptom started with acid reflux but got progressively worse to the point I couldn't even drink in the end without it coming back up. I did have an operation for this and everything was fine for a year then I suffered with muscle spasms of the oesophagus, these are extremely painful but I now have Borulinum toxin injection (Botox) which has been a great help. I am sorry this doesn't help you but I hope you find out the cause very soon and don't have to suffer too long before you find out exactly what the cause is.  Hi Cathie, Thanks for your reply. Sorry to hear about what you have been suffering with that doesnt sound nice at all. I hope the botox continues to give you some relief. Yes im struggling for ideas as to what could be causing my issues. Another thing which I should have mentioned is that my mouth is contastly so dry, I drink tons of water but its doesnt help. These things must be linked. This is the most bizzare symptoms that I have heard of! I feel for you but I wanted to respond to let you know that most doctors chalk mysterious symptoms like this to Acid Reflux. It's so typical and it also happened to me and I have Achalasia. It generally takes about 2 years for a diagnosis and 40% of the time doctors get it wrong. If I were you I would try and see a Throat Dr. I feel like they will be able to guide to correctly. Also it sounds like you may also have burning mouth syndrome with the dryness issue. Look into this with the Ear, Nose and Throat Doctor. It's a good start and most know what they are doing! Good luck.. Hi, I have had your symptoms. For me it was reflux, although it was more obvious since I could feel the heartburn. I don't know about \"silent reflux\" or its rarity; my symptoms included a numb-ish-feeling throat and odd sensations, especially like something caught in my throat near the top and just a general sense of swollenness in my throat, under my jaw and occasionally in my tongue, making me mumble words from time to time. Basically, the most worrying part of them was just that things like swallowing or spitting felt somehow 'different' or 'uncomfortable', and there was a minor soreness, but mostly it was just very worrying. What a lot of the swelling sensation might be is from two sources: The general inflammation from the reflux, and the tails of your tonsils becoming inflamed and enlarged, which lie deeper in your throat than you can see. You should see a GI, and they will probably want to do an upper endoscopy or a CT; if you are experiencing that degree of erosion, you probably have pathological symptoms lower in your esophagus which can eventually become quite problematic in a variety of ways. The ENT has little to offer you; if they can't see it from in your mouth, then the only other things they can do is a sinuscopy (which is very limited in the parts of your throat that can be explored, and is wholly unpleasant!) or send you to a radiologist for a CT, as far as non-surgical things go. The gastroenterologist has the much more sophisticated endoscopy, and can also order a CT if they think it's a good idea. So really, I agree with your doctor in that the GI is the next step in your diagnosis. Good luck, stop stressing! Hi everyone, So just an update on this and hopefully some advice if anyone has any. So around a year on from when my throat went \"numb\" or when the swallow mechanism and cartilage seemed to stop moving correctly, I am still here with exactly the same symptoms. I tried medication for reflux but that made no change. Im sure it isn't reflux thats causing these symptoms anyway; I have since been back and seen another ENT who said I do not have reflux and there is no sign of any reflux, so im not sure what the previous ENT saw, think he just wanted to fob me off. Anyway the ENT doesn't know what suggest regarding my numb throat, they cant see anything wrong inside the throat using the camera but he said maybe there is some damage to some cartilidge or a ligamant in there causing these symptoms but he doesnt have any ideas on what can be done and says it may be something I have to live with. Not exactly what I wanted to hear. Anyway I was refered on to a speech therapist to see if they had any ideas. I have seen them a few times now and they cannot work out what is going on either. I had a video flouroscopy/barium swollow study, they could not see anything signifcant other than my epiglottis apparently looks bunced up and the whole are looks tense and restricted they say. They dont know what to suggest and say theres not anything more they can do. So now im really not sure what to do? Something has structurally malfuctioned in my throat, the whole area is swollen and often aches by the end of the day. When I swollow with my head in a normal position if feels like the throat cartilidge is unable to move upwards freely and contract as it would when normal, It feels like there is something blocking the upward movement and I imagine this would be why I feel no sensation \"numb\" in the throat when I swallow. If I tilt my head slightly forward and down when I swollow there is a loud crack like the cartidldge is trying to move upward past something but it gets caught on it and clicks on the way up. Has anyone experienced anything like this? Did you manage to find out what it was and find a resolution? Would really appreciate any ideas. Maybe I try and push for an MRI? cant see them giving me one though. Sorry for such a long post, this numb non existent swallow, the swelling and the clicking is just really getting me down.  <p>I literally have the same symptoms as you! I have crackling in throat feels like I need to clear my throat, numbness in throat, my ears pop, it&#39;s so bizarre!! </p> <p> My grandmother had something very similar to what you&#39;re having. Have you been tested for a hyanial hernia ( i&#39;m sure I did not spell that correctly)</p> <p>Please tell me you still get on !! So i read your first post about the brain fog headaches ringing etc and your symptoms matched mine literally to a TEE so I clicked your profile, seen this post and I also have this issue as well!!!!!!! There is no way that&#39;s a coincidence !</p> <p>I suffer these symptoms too, it&#39;s horrendous and made worse by not getting any answers from tests or scans. I have seen two ENTs and neither can get to the bottom of it but just say it might be calcification or ossification of a cartilage and not to worry, yet for me it has got progressively worse from first happening very rarely when I swallowed saliva to now happening virtually all the time with food and drink.&#160;</p><p>Google searches are scary and throw up multiple possible causes ranging from serious neurological and autoimmune diseases to TMJ problems and tight pterygoid muscles. The numb sensation is the worst bit for me, it&#39;s like I can&#39;t tell if I have swallowed properly and worry that it might have gone down the wrong hole <img src=\"http://s8.patient.media/forums/emoticons/sad.gif\" alt=\"sad\" />&#160;</p><p>Has anyone had any answers or progress since they last posted? It is reassuring to know a few people have the same symptoms, hopefully one of us will strike it lucky with a diagnosis and pass it on.&#160;</p>"

          "Hi all, I have had this issue for a few months now. Basically my throat as in the larnyx, adams, apple, thyroid area outside of the throat seems to swell up and became extremely painful to swallow, so this is other throat rather then inside the throat like a sore throat. Anyway, this seemed to flare up and I was having clicking and cracking in my throat when swallowing. One day I was eating some bread and there was loud crack when I swallowed, after that swalloing was extremely painful, and it was difficult to get food down, this was all still outer throat, from reading I think it would probably be the thyroid cartilage and larynx that were swollen and somehow causing these issues. I could deal with the pain but then one morning I woke up and my throat now what felt like the inside of my throat had gone completely numb, literally like I had sucked on a numbing throat sweet. It also feels like my swallow mechinism is somehow not working correctly, like I can swallow but there is no sensation and it feels like the normal movement of the throat cartilidge is now somehow stuck and not moving freely when I swallow. Anyway I went to the doctors who brushed it off as nothing the first couple of times, then I saw a different doctor and explained what had happened and he refered me to the ENT specialist. I have seen the ENT specialist and he has diagnosed me with silent Reflux, basically acid reflux but without the heartburn etc. I dont think I agree with this diagnosis and want to get to the bottom of the numb malfuctioning swallow as the numb sensation is so strange and horrible it is driving me mad with anxiety. I do not really have any symptoms of slient reflux/acid reflux. The way these issues started all on my outer throat would not match acid reflux either, as well as the fact my throat went numb so suddenly. Maybe it isnt numb and it is just that my swollow mechanism is not working correctly but it sure feels numb. It literally feels like nothing happens when I swallow, there is no recognition or sensation when I swallow unless I get a click noise which i assume is the swollen cartilge getting caught somehow. The area is still swollen from top of neck/throat to the bottom. As I have been diagnosed with reflux doctors will just now fob me off without any sort of solution. I am taking the medication for this so called silent reflux I have just to see if there is any change but there has been none so far. If it is silent reflux how would I even no if medication is working as I have no symptoms like heartburn, sort throat, voice issues or anything. Anyway sorry for such a long post, has anyone else experienced something like this? Does anyone have any idea what it could be and what I can do about it? Thanks"

          " Hi. Your symptoms sound like hiatal hernia. Do the barium swallow test to find out. Stu <p>Sorry to hear about your symptoms. You can try raising the top of your bed up, use blocks rather than just pillows. Raising it up will help gravity keep your stomach contents away from the top of your stomach. Also don&#39;t eat three hours before going to bed but take some Gaviscon Advance just before you do. These actions will not cure you but should help relieve your nighttime symptoms. Good luck</p> Hi, Ive been having these symptoms for 2 years 5months now. I did the barium swallow and it resulted that I have a hiatus hernia. I did an endoscopy and resulted that my stomach valve doesnt close properly and there is nothing I can do. I took a course of emoprazole(it has been months now that I finisehd them), I am much better at least I am managing to sleep but I am nauseous 24/7 and that feeling of lump in my throat is always there for me. Gaviscon chewable tablets are the only thing I take when I have heartburn.Going to try and do the acupuncture next wednesday, hopefully it will help! <p>Hey,</p><p></p><p>I&#39;m sory to hear you&#39;re feeling this way. I&#39;m starting to think any stomach upset causes this level of anxiety since I have never been as anxious as when I began to exprience stomach issues last year.</p><p></p><p>First things first - did you take antibiotics for your throat? a LOT of people here developed GERD after an infection, especially if they took antibiotics to allegedly clear things up.</p><p></p><p>Secondly - where are you travelling? Are you in Eastern countries? Do you have any other stomach issues or lower GI/IBS symptoms? You might have picked up a bacteria, which would be treated by your doctor.</p><p></p><p>I&#39;m not a doctor, but I have been assaulted with symptoms over the past few months so I&#39;ve learned a lot from other people, peer reviewed medical journals, my friends in medicine, and friends who I have discovered also have GERD. A number of things can cause it. If you have excess gas and bloating, it can push your stomach up, and consequently the acid. It could be an infection called h pylori which is treated with antibiotics. A round of antibiotics may have been too strong for your system and it&#39;s knocked it off. Then structural issues would be looked at, like hiatal hernias or a weakened lower oesopageal sphyncter muscloes (LES for short). Occasionally bacterial infections or yeast like candida can affect your oesophagus and cause this.</p><p></p><p>For me, the first 3 months were hell because I had oesophagitis after 2 rounds of antibiotics. I don&#39;t know if I swallowed a pill that didn&#39;t go down right because I was always too scared to get an endoscopy. Or if it was a bacterial imbalance. I developed huge anxiety too and I think my stomach being off makes my anxiety go through the roof because it physiologically feels unsettled and like it&#39;s nervous. I wouldn&#39;t say I was better, I don&#39;t want to dishearten you, BUT I am 70 - 80% better than I was when I was just diagnosed with this. And I had additional symptoms like not being able to swallow, tingly irritation and extreme nausea and tightness, which is why it took me longer to heal I think. Here&#39;s what helped me:</p><p></p><p>- Omeprazole for 12 weeks to heal the oesophagus (ppi drugs lower acid). It did make me feel sick sometimes and like food wasn&#39;t digesting. I am now off these since February.</p><p>- PROBIOTICS. I take a 7 strain mix every day. They are wee life savers.</p><p>- Eating bland foods for a while.</p><p>- Propping up my pillows at night.</p><p>- Digestive enzymes helped me when it was really extreme.</p><p>- On worse days I reduce my portion sizes, eating little and often, not letting my stomach get empty.</p><p>- Marshmallow root, ginger and lemon tea. I know, lemon is a contradition but it has really helped ease my stomach.</p><p>- Not going anywhere near raw veg, citrus fruit.</p><p>- A stool sample to let me know what bacteria are in my gut (I have high levels of strep and staph which I don&#39;t think are doing me any favours).</p><p></p><p>I think my own symptoms are caused by bloating and gas build up that I now exprience after certain foods. When the food ferments and bacteria feed on it in the colon, I will burp a lot and this is when I get bubbly burps in my throat. But I rarely get heartburn now, have a very healthy appetite most days, and am still working on reducing anxiety. There is hope, try and research some remedies and maybe see a nutritionist. Good luck:)</p> <p>Omg I feel your pain Hun I have been there. Look it can and will get better. Raising the top of your bed is a brilliant suggestion and should bring u some relief. I took sleeping pills but never the full dose. I halved my tablets. I was on them for about 4 months when I was at my worst! You gotta do what you gotta do. I didn&#39;t like taking the tabs but they saved me from a nervous breakdown. </p><p></p><p>Where did u go travelling? I&#39;m wondering if you have picked up parasites? </p><p></p><p>Have you had a barium swallow test or an endoscopy? You need to find out if you have a hiatus hernia, this can stop the Les muscle closing properly. </p><p>The difficult part of all this is finding out what is causing the gerd? The docs don&#39;t seem interested in that, they just wanna give u meds. Here is some stuff you could research:</p><p></p><p>Food allergies</p><p>SIBO </p><p>Hiatus hernia</p><p>Parasites</p><p>Candida</p><p></p><p>I use dgl licorice tabs and licorice tea to help with heartburn. I also use gaviscon extra when I&#39;m really bad. Have u tried probiotics or digestive enzymes? </p><p></p><p>I&#39;m trying L-glutamine at the mo and having acupuncture weekly. </p><p> </p><p>Are you a very stressed person? Cos this messes up your digestion big time. You need to manage your stress. This is so important when dealing with this disease. </p><p></p><p>Diet is very important too but don&#39;t stress over food. Do you know what your trigger foods are? </p><p>Some suggest a low carb diet is very helpful. I don&#39;t feel good on low carb diet though. I get really cranky and lose a lot of weight. </p><p></p><p>There are operations available if nothing else helps but I don&#39;t think your anywhere need that stage yet. </p><p></p><p>Good luck Hun. Hope this helps</p><p>Dominique </p><p></p> <p>Sounds like extra-oesophageal reflux. Find the www DownWithAcid org uk encyclopaedia for more info - and see attached graphic.</p><p>It&#39;s not what we eat that&#39;s important but how we eat. Small meals (little and often), eaten slowly, chewed well and no exercise whilst the stomach empties.</p>"

          "<p>I&#39;m 23 and I have never experienced anything like this before. I have been traveling and was sick for about 2 weeks with pharyngitis. After finally recovering from this sickness, a new problem started and I started experiencing heartburn especially bad at night when I lay down to go to sleep. I&#39;ve seen a few doctors and all have told me it is GERD and given me medications - Omezaprole 20mg, gaviscon liquid, air-x -which I have been taking for a week but my pain persists. It seems to be getting worse for me. I now have a dry sore throat, lump feeling, cough, ear pain, chest tightness, heartburn, burning sensation in my whole upper body. I also feel stiffness/soreness in my neck/back. I have little appetite and can not sleep well at night so I feel extremely fatigued during the day. It&#39;s really affecting my mood and causing me anxiety. I&#39;m generally pretty healthy and I don&#39;t eat spicy foods, generally just drink water. I usually do drink coffee but I haven&#39;t since being sick. I don&#39;t feel the heartburn is triggered from eating - I am eating just so I can take my medication but not generally very hungry lately. It&#39;s been every night that I have trouble sleeping. I&#39;ve taken sleeping pills some nights but I don&#39;t want to rely on them so I try not to. I feel like this is never going away and I just have no energy during the day and haven&#39;t felt like myself. I just want to get back to normal but I don&#39;t know what to do. Please help!!</p>"

          " I'm going through something similar except I'm at 10 weeks. I have enough to go to work around 3 days and week and also do some exercise including bike rides, light exercises at home, walks etc... But nowhere near my previous level of energy. How is your energy level now? Can you manage daily activities (cooking etc...) and some exercise? Also I'm sleeping terrible. Not very deep sleep, and waking up every 1-2 hours or so. I think it is due to an over-reactive immune system. Even though the virus is gone your immune system thinks it's still there and keeps on fighting it causing symptoms and inflammation. It will take time for it to settle down. Doctor also found I was very vitamin D deficient, which might also explain why I'm feeling fatigued and can't sleep properly. I hope this is the case.  Quite a few of your symptoms sound like you could have acid reflux, food coming up, back pain, nausea, not being able to take a full breath yet having good oxygen levels and neck pain. Try taking some esomeprazole every day for this and see if it helps. If you have tested negative for the covid 19 virus twice, what makes you so convinced this is what your symptoms are? There are so many other things they could be. A lot of your symptoms could be explained by anxiety.  I am coming up for eight weeks with this. Symptoms include continuous burning throat and chest, chest pain fatigue. Have also sometimes had headaches, rashes, diarrhoea. Sleep generally ok at 8 hours but wake a few times with symptoms. .Went back to short work days in week 5. Symptoms in waves with two or three bad followed by good . Worst after i had done a bit more activity, over maybe three day period. Not really improved since week 5. Was prescribed omeprazole 3 weeks ago but no difference. Find meditation helps lesson symptoms. Have now signed off work for at least 2 weeks. I intend to do as little as possible during this time. Hi, I also tested positive for covid about 9 weeks ago. I think I had it mildly compared to some people. a lot of different symptoms like yours but no temperture. The Covid left me with a bad rash and I still have that rash. Today for the first time in a few weeks I felt really bad tightness and pain in my chest and slight shortness of breath. I've never felt so anxious, especially with 3 kids! it scares me so much but I don't know if I'm just being anxious. I've been retested cus of the rash 2 weeks ago but that was negative. hope this helps xx hi, I'm in week 10, In bed today again with flu like symptoms and exhaustion. i had the virus mildly, considering what could have happened, for two weeks. then went back to work for three, then crashed again for two, then back 0.5 or two, now in bed again. at first i was scared, and felt like no one else was relapsing, but now i realise there are quite a few of us. it is frustrating, but I'm trying to think this will be fine in three to six months. that way I'm realistic and realistic with my work place. it sucks, but at least we're alive.  I am in week 9 of virus symptoms. I am 37, no underlying health conditions, fit and healthy. Never been tested as i only requested medical attention (GP) in week 3, by which point i was told there was no point as it wouldn't test positive. So far i have had two lots of antibiotics, two lots of steriods and i have an inhaler. I did test postive for a bacterial chest infestion around week 6, which i was told would of been a secondary infection to the virus. I have also just had a chest xray which has come back normal. I had all the main symptoms, fever, aches, cough, conjunctivitis, diorreha, shortness of breath, fast heart rate, sore throat, reflux, shakes, headaches, sore sinuses, click in my throat when swallow, fatigue, really bad back pain in upper back, burning sensation in back. I am still struggling a lot with some symptoms, mainly my throat/windpipe hurts constantly like its inflammed, feels like i have a lump in my throat all the time. Getting loads of headaches and ear ache. It really hurts when i take a deep breath in and i get out of breath doing small walks/tasks. Still coughing a lot which gets worse after light exercise. I have only just started being able to sleep on my side again as it was too painful. I am so fed up of telling people i am still ill, each day i wake up hoping that today will be the day im better but its just not happening. I am not taking any medication currently, just trying to keep the pain at bay with ibuprophen and paracetamol.  I have had pretty much most of the covid-19 symptoms since the start of March. only two weeks ago I thought I had recovered from the illness, only in the past few days I have been suffering with a sore throat, swollen glands in my neck, inflamed nose, migraine and a slight temperature, on top of that I have been having gastric issues such as acid reflux and active bowel movements. It is difficult to sleep, but not impossible. This will be the 8th week of on and off battles with these symptoms. I hope for everyone this all passes by and we can return back to normality. im so glad to have found this forum, i started feeling unwell about 8 weeks ago at early stages of covid i didnt have fever or cough so didnt get tested, i did have sore throat, chills , extream fatigue , body heating up and like ice the next, ive never felt so weard the symptoms continue still now, body tingling, crawling, fatigue trouble sleeping, heating up at night like burning. i have no underlaying conditions healthy eat well excercise etc before, recovery is very difficult. is anyone else experiencing prickling, tingling weeks later? thx Hi. 10 weeks on from very mild virus - nasal drip, hoarse voice, sore tongue - week 4 developed mottled forearms and fingers, hands and toes change from white to red to purple randomly - swollen glands come and go all day too. All those symptoms still with me. As others have said - every day a new symptom and no real improvement at all. Usually you get ill - and then there is a steady recovery. With this - just endless and unknown."

          "I've been unwell with the virus for over 9 weeks. I am in my 30s with no underlying health conditions. I have had so many different symptoms at different stages; sore throat, fever, nausea, diarrhoea, gastric issues such as feeling like food is coming up my oesophagus, dry throat, intense upper back pain, weakness, muscle pain in my arms, neck pain, fast heart rate, sensations in left side of my face, breathlessness which is not severe but feels like I can't get a deep breath in, pins and needles in my hands, what feels like pain in my bone in my lower leg, stinging and teary eyes, headaches, stomach pain.... The first 3 weeks were probably the worst as I was unable to get out of bed, week 4 saw a marked improvement and I thought I was recovering with nearly all symptoms disappearing save for some gastric issues but then in week 5 I started to relapse. I had pain in my back again and new symptoms of muscle pain in my arms, pain in my joints and a lot of tension in my upper body. I have tested negative for the virus twice now in weeks 5 and 6. I am over 9 weeks into the virus and am still suffering from muscle pain, breathlessness that feels like I can't get a deep breath in, gastric issues and stinging and teary eyes. All bloods and oxygen sats have been normal. Has anyone out there had similar for this length of time or longer? I am also confused about testing negative for the virus while presenting new symptoms. I've been told I'm not infectious any more so have been trying to take walks outside. I am trying to be as active as I can, some days are better some are worse. I am trying very hard to get better and am eating well even if I find it difficult. I feel there's a whole community out there of people like me that need guidance for prolonged symptoms but there is no advice from the health professionals and it is very unnerving."

          " I think the world on this board empathises with you, Peter. They are all your ship mates and wish you a speedy journey. Don't forget DGL licorice and mm-mm-good Manuka Honey; a natural restorative. Above all, don't forget the power of your own good faith; it will rocket you towards success.  Hi Pete, your symptoms sound very similar to mine. Mine started two days after Christmas, for no obvious reason, and got steadily worse throughout Jan and Feb. My GP also prescribed Lanzoprazole, but the packet (and my pharmacist) says take it 30 -60 mins before food, preferably in the morning, so I keep mine by the bed for when I wake up. I have found it has helped somewhat , but I'm still on it, in fact on two a day (another one before dinner) because I was worse recently. Feeling better just now so will prob cut down to one again. I got referred to an ENT consultant like lots of contributors to this forum, and he looked at my throat and vocal cords and confirmed swelling and redness. Then I've recently seen a Gastro-enterologist who has done a gastroscopy (tube down to the stomach) and found a hiatus hernia. This may or may not be responsible for my LPR. He wasn't interested in testing me for pepsin so I got my own test and sent it off today. Maybe you should do another one sometime and do it more accurately, and lay off the alkaline water for 48hours first. My worst symptom just now is asthma, which I've never suffered from before, but had 4 attacks in a week. Not sure of my next step yet, but went to see my chiropractor yesterday about an unrelated thing and when I told him why I was coughing and throat clearing he said he might be able to help, and has treated voice and swallowing problems before. He does this by treating the nerve pathways in the neck which can affect breathing and digestion. Like most sufferers, I'll try anything! I'll report back if I feel significant benefit from this. Stress definitely makes things worse, so try not to worry. I have felt very low myself, but I find being proactive helps, so you feel you are doing all you can for yourself. Certainly this forum, and other stuff on the internet has been extremely helpful, as the various docs don't always seem to know that much.  Hey Pete I feel your pain. I'll share my experience in the hope it may help. Mine started after a really stressful time. Classic lump in the throat, not being able to swallow, then waking in the middle of the night choking and gagging. Docs all said there was nothing wrong with my throat and I felt as if i was going mad. I had a constant awful taste too. Tried omeprazole but it made things worse. Eventually got referred to ENT who found a unilateral patch of red. He said it was impossible for it to be LPR but I knew it was. Had such a foul taste in my mouth all the time and my throat was always sore. Anyway they referred me for an MRI of the throat, meanwhile I had a gastroscopy which showed oesophagitis ( making swallowing difficult) and gastritis. I was prescribed a double dose of Lansoprazole ( so 20mg twice per day) and also Gaviscon Advance to be taken after meals and at bedtime. The Lansoprazole didn't do it for me and my gp changed me to Esomeprazole 20mg twice per day. I also raised the head of my bed by 8 inches (made a massive difference) and cut acid causing things out of my diet. 3 months on and my oesophagus and stomach have both healed ( had another gastroscopy recently) and I feel tons better. I'm not a fan of tablet taking but in my case the Esomeprazole really worked. I'm hoping to reduce the dose by half next time I go to see the docs. LPR is hard because you can't tell your trigger foods as easily as someone with classic heartburn, but it is treatable. My throat was the first thing to heal. It may be worth going to your doc and asking to try the Esomeprazole. They are top of the heap when it comes to ppis. Least side effects for most benefit. I'm so glad I changed. Good luck with everything and any questions just let me know . Thank you Meunier and Jill, nice to know if nothing else im not the only sufferer Keep me posted on your outcomes Thanks Stella You've definitely come to the right place Pete! Everything you describe sounds like all the symptons the majority of people are suffering from on this forum. The only suggestion I have that may help is to gargle with the alkaline water. 30 mins after every meal. I find that just drinking the water doesn't quite kill off all the pepsin that can attach itself, but gargling usually does the trick. I too did the peptest. It may be worth contacting biomed direct with your concerns and questions as they are probably best placed to answer? I think you've hit the nail on the head with the diet. A lot of people swear by a book called dropping acid by Dr Koufman, and have found huge relief by having a more alkaline diet.  I agree about exploring different things but I would also like to put this in context. I tried for months to make things better without tablets. I hate taking any tablets, but when I started coughing up blood, and then found I had barretts I decided that tablets were the route I had to take. From research and experience I can tell you that acid rebound affects less than half of the people on ppis, and it's only if you are on them longer than 3 months. At one point I was on 80mg of Esomeprazole a day. I cut this by half myself and had no ill effects whatsoever. My next step is to cut the tablets out altogether now I'm healed and take them as and when I need them, relying on the Gaviscon stop any rebound. Rebound if you do get it is temporary and resolves within a few weeks whilst your body readjusts. I'm not an advocate of ppis by any stretch of the imagination, but just to let you know that if all else fails it isn't the end of the world, and they can actually help. Well, they have with me and I was the most anti ppi person in the world til I found out about the Barretts. Maybe the first step is to get a gastro referral and get a gastroscopy then at least you'll know what you are dealing with. In the meantime, the two things that helped the most before my diagnosis were raising the head of the bed and not eating or drinking after 7pm. Simple to do but very effective.  Thanks for all the replys and ideas its very difficult to know what to do for the best.. Drives you mad !  Forgot to add I also get a feeling of something stuck feeling after eaten smack bang in the middle of My chest abut at the bottom of the chest between the rib cage right in the centre any one get this to ?"

          "Hi All My problem started around 12 months ago after a bad bout of chest/lung infection treated by anti biotics and i have not been right since. Im not saying it has anything to do with it but it seemed to start after that. I have daily the trying to clear my throat especially in the morning after i get up usually after i have eaten. This clearing is normally combined with a couch or tickle type cough in the morning. It usually subsides after an hour or so but starts again anytime of day and during the afternoon usually. I also get Hoarseness sometimes in the throat the sort off feeling like you get if youve been shouting or none stop talking and you voice struggles. In addition i sometimes get a lump in the throat feeling to. When i go to bed i dont get any problems during the night its just the rest of the day. Im guessing after reading this thread/forum that its LPR silent reflux I have . Does anyone else experience this as it really gets me down and I worry a lot. Im quite a stressful person and hate going to the doctors. I have also just received the results from the biomed peptest which both samples tested positive one at moderate 99 ng/ml and the other at very high 250 ng/ml . Im not sure i did the test correct as i left it several weeks before doing it and didnt store the tubes in the fridge as i found out later i should have. I also did the 2 samples at the same time so am a little confused why one was 99 and the other 250 ?? Anyway is saw my GP today and explained what was going on and my peptest and she didnt seem to fully understand imho.. she as told me to take one Lansoprazole each night and if things dont improve go back in a month. I know they wont work as i have tried them before. I am drinking alkaline water but not really noticed any difference so know going to change my diet. Has anyone got any tips , medication suggestions etc..etc.. I am desperate to get help as worried about the long term damange. Is anyone going through the same ??? Cheers Pete UK"

          " Quite similar to me Travis. I was going to the gym every lunch time and then running nearly every night in preparation for a marathon. I believe my body just gave up on me and said enough is enough. Thay was 2 years ago. I've had various highs and lows since then - I've just had to accept I can't really do any exercise anymore. I see an ME/CFS specialist every couple of months but thats about it. I've just accepted life won't be the same and dont push myself anymore - since I've done that I feel pretty good and lead a relatively normal life :-)  Hi Travis, you sound a lot like myself. I'm 37 but used to run 20 to 30 miles a week. I completed the Great North Run in September and it has been down hill since then. However in March my rather astute Gastroenterologist noted my fatigue and sent me for a Vitamin D test. My level was 45 which is insufficient, but resulted in muscle and bone pain, fatigue to the point where I could barely walk 5 minutes, dizziness and a whole host of other issues. After 8 weeks of high dose Vitamin D treatment I am starting to feel a bit better, although it can take months apparently to fully replenish your levels. I would ask for a quick Vitamin D blood test if I was you and you haven't been tested. It can't hurt and you should have the results in 4 or 5 days.  Hi Travis, similar story here, semi-pro triathlete/marathon runner, 8+years. I'm 35 feeling 95. was 33 when i fell ill. I was working in a fast paced physical warehouse job for 2 years prior to becoming sick, 3.30am rises for 5am start, i would cycle to work and back again, then after work go swimming, goto the gym etc I feel ill around Nov2013 with viral like symptoms, come January 2014 i thought i was dying, my heart felt so weak, i'm never sick, called an ambulance on more than one ocassion. So like you been tested from head to toe over 18 months and ntothing signifciant is ever detected. Do you get very heavy feeling legs ? some days my legs can feel like concrete. I've been working with a local Chinese doctor who has diagnosed me with kidney yang deficinecy, which is believe is along the lines of adrenal burnout, it migh be something to consdier. Adrenals take a while to heal. I see the same CFS story over and over again with folks that were extremely active and get CFS, surely this is a burnout phenomenon ? The Chinese have the best explanation in their life essence jing theory, as it would make sense as to why our blood work etc are all normal. This is a horrible illness and i wouldn' wish it on anyone. Recovery is possible. Unfortunatly I have found that doctors are generally useless if you find a good one hold on with dear life. you sound a lot like me I have multi complex of things going on all similar to you. I have been diagnoised with cronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. I have every symptom of MS but only without the pins and needles and numbness. Doctors unfortuanatly are only allowing 10 minute appointments and like everyone overworked no time to be interested. good luck keep fighting with the doctors insist on being refered to specialist i.e reumatologist Nurolologist get checked for sleep apnea I insisted on seeing nurologist but never thought in a million that I would have it but i have severe sleep apnea and NO i do not snore loudly or all the time everyone is different. But keep fighting and insisting try and get an MRI scan to rule out MS  Hi Travis, doesn't surprise me with G.P.'s fortunately I have a good one. With CFS/ME symptoms, if a person has had them over 6 month period then you have a right to be referred to a specialist who performs in this area. So I would ask, and if you don't receive then tell them you have a right to see a specialist in this field for a diagnosis or not. A specialist is the only one who can give you the official diagnosis. Go to Action for M.E site for information and help. All the very best, it does seem that things have been dragging on too long for you. Tx  Hi Travis Sorry to hear your unwell. It all sound very familiar I was very active. In some cases, CFS develops into M.E. I have suffered for the past 20 years with the disease (M.E), and as a result had to curtail most if not all of my previous life style. Don\u2019t push your body to do what you once could do while its compromised, you will get in to a boom and bust cycle of feeling OK overdoing it and being bad for 3 to 5 days and then repeating the cycle. Most doctors cannot put a finger on the cause or an effective treatment in most cases, they can check to see what it is not, and work from there. It is a case of check for the obvious and what you are left with is perhaps it. The treatments offered for the condition is mixed and the result\u2019s people get from taking certain medicines is mixed also, more of a hit and miss style of treatment. No one cure all for this disease as of yet. What works for me might only help 5 to 10% of other suffers the 90 to 95% of suffers it gives no help or makes them worst. I hope my slant on CFS/ME is helpful, even if it is not the answer you wanted. After suffering for 20 years, you tend to take your life off hold and make the best of the situation you find yourself in. live with it and do not fight it as it has a habit of biting back. Oh, people do die from this it is not nice at all\u2026 I read on line the UK government has researched the condition/disease and locked the findings away for 70+ years under the official secrets act, so what they discovered about it is anybody\u2019s guess. Perhaps simply no cure?  Hi Travis, I have CFS almost 2 years, prior to that fit 40 YO male, working out 3-4 times a week....golf etc. For almost 2 years everything on hold. Getting through each day is a struggle. Tried many things but no success yet. Its very tough to live with."

          "Prior to becoming ill in September of 2014, I was an extremely active individual. I was 25 years old, was 6\u20190\u201d, and weighed 203 lbs. I ran 3-8 miles a day 5 days a week, biked 30 miles 2 of those days, and played soccer 2 nights a week. I frequently went fishing and diving and enjoyed high-intensity supports. I was a personal trainer and a cross fit coach. I recently received my master\u2019s degree in mental health and rehabilitation counseling. I do no smoke cigarettes and I do not drink alcohol. Since becoming ill my physical activity has diminished to a walk around the block. When this happens I become extremely tired. If I push myself and try to run I\u2019ll be on my butt for 2 days with flu-like symptoms \u2013 chills, swollen and sore lymphs, weakness in muscles, and just general malaise. I am now 180lbs. Some things I\u2019ve noticed are that my symptoms had gotten better in the winter months, but still very difficult to manage. I became more active but I had to take at least 800mg of ibuprofen daily (as prescribed by rheumatologist.) Every time I have been on antibiotics it seems like all of my symptoms became 10 x worse. The only drastic change to my life has been my place of work where I was exposed to black mold from January 1st 2014 \u2013 April 15th 2015. When I became sick our air conditioning at our office went out for 5 days. I have been to nine different doctors now and no one has treated me for toxic mold exposure. I am not saying that this is what I have, but up until this point no one has even looked into it. Two separate doctors have diagnosed me with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I was a perfectly healthy, active, individual prior to September 2014. I want to be very clear that I am not trying to get my employer in trouble; I simply want to be well again. I had everything in my life going extremely well until I became sick. I am posting in this forum to see if anyone has gone through something similar.

It made \u00be of the roommates very ill, including myself, to the point where we had to move into a hotel. The landlord replaced everything, we moved back in and the symptoms diminished over time.

November 19th (Rheumatologist) \u00b7 Interchange Ibuprofen and Tylenol Daily \u00b7 Diagnosis: CFS isn\u2019t supported in medical community. \u00b7 Diagnosed that it was \u201cprobably just a virus.\u201d December 8th \u2013 (Holistic Doctor) \u00b7 IV Push for Vitamins \u00b7 10k mg Vitamin D Daily for a month \u00b7 Flax Seed Oil December 2014 \u2013 FULL TIME AT NEW OFFICE (Mold) December 15th \u2013 Rheumatology Follow Up \u00b7 Blood work Results All Negative for Lyme, Autoimmune Diseases, and \u00b7 Diagnosis: This is a virus and I will continue to get better over time February 23rd \u2013 I tried playing soccer again but every time I did I became extremely run down and sick the day after. I was nowhere near the level of play that I am used to performing because I felt so sick. Feb 26th-March 2nd Colorado March 16th Rheumatologist follow up \u00b7 Said because I had played a full game of soccer I should be okay. However, I he recommended I do not take ibuprofen and/or Tylenol everyday. I talked to him about how difficult it is for me to breathe and to catch my breath. He said I should have nothing to worry about and it would go away. \u00b7 Diagnosed me with CFS and said I would eventually return to baseline. April 27th 2015 \u2013 PCP \u00b7 (my new pcp because of insurance transfer) because many of the same symptoms came back. I have not used ibuprofen or Tylenol since I saw Rheumatologist \u00b7 Azithromycin 500 mg 10 qt \u00b7 Fluconazole 100mg 14 qt The anti-biotic made me much worse.

My sinuses pressure skyrockets, my body feels like it has the flu again, and all of the symptoms I listed above are exacerbated. I have pictures from my place of work that I took so I could show the doctors some of what I\u2019ve been breathing in for the past year and a half. Recently, I have been in touch with someone who has gone to the national treatment center for environmental diseases to focus on a mold exposure. I went on the same restrictive diet they told her to go on for a month. Non-starchy vegetables and any type of organic meat. I did this for 17 days. I was supposed to do a month. I didn\u2019t feel like I had much improvement until I started reintroducing processed food back in to my diet. Headaches came back tenfold and all of my symptoms are severely exacerbated within 2 hours of me eating a meal. Antibiotics have a similar effect. Needless to say after 2 days of feeling terrible I am back on the diet. I supplement with L-Glutathione, vitamin c, omega 3 fish oil, glutamine powder, probiotic, synchro gold (turmeric), and non-flush niacin. My symptoms go from a 10 to about a 4 when I changed my diet back. I have been to 9 doctors now. I have written their diagnosis. Not one has a actually diagnosed it, they just suspect that\u2019s what it is. 2 PCP\u2019s (Virus, Candida from Mold Exposure), ENT - Sinusitis, then CFS, then Migraines, Rheumatologist \u2013 Viral Infection and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Walk-In Clinic (Sinusitis), ER (Nothing), Allergist/Immunologist (Unsure referred to Infectious Disease, Neurologist (Myasthenia Gravis \u2013 Running Tests now), Holistic Doctor \u2013 (Virus), I have an appointment for an infectious disease doctor coming up. If this is a fungal infection, why are there no doctors who will treat it? Every time I bring up the fact that I worked in a mold environment seem to dismiss it because \u201cI\u2019m not allergic to mold.\u201d Let me know your thoughts. Thank you for taking the time to read it."

          " Hi Abbie! First, I want to say that I am SO SORRY to hear that you are having SO MANY issues with your GI tract all at the same time! For being just TWENTY years old it is very concerning to hear of all of the things that are happening to you! You mentioned that your diagnosis was a year and a half ago. Prior to that can you think of the last time that you felt well? I'm trying to think of possibly some illness or event that happened that could have started you down this difficult path. Regarding your teeth, did you seen a dentist, periodontist regularly prior to all of your issues? Could your teeth/ gum issues be a contributing cause of your problems rather than just a result of your gerd, gastritis and hiatal hernia? You may have strep throat which can be quite problematic to your entire system. I'm thinking an infection which is causing you to feel so badly. Do you have a fever? Often the medications we take can cause issues in OTHER body systems. I would wonder if the medications you are taking MIGHT be increasing your problems. A trip to your dentist might offer more insight into your condition. Have you tried yogurt? Yogurt with active cultures can restore healthy bacteria that can get your GI tract back to a healthier place. This helps me greatly, and I definitely know when I need to have some yogurt to balance out my system! It is especially helpful after a colonoscopy cleans out your regular intestinal flora! Something else to try is eliminating gluten. Our daughter-in-law was having severe stomach issues and ended up in the ER following a dinner at a local restaurant. Turned out she had Celiac Disease and was allergic to gluten! After eliminating gluten, within a week she was able to stop all of her stomach meds. Within two weeks she felt better than she had for years. Certainly worth a try! These are some of my thoughts based on your symptoms and my experience with stomach issues. I would also suggest getting a second opinion from a different doctor who is more sympathetic to your situation. When we feel bad we feel BAD! We want HELP. Please let us know how things go for you. I hope you will be able to get answers very soon that will help you toward feeling much better. Dear Abbie, sorry to hear about all this ,i too just got the wammie,what i have found is to really help is probiotics and hemp powder banana and chia made with almond milk blend and drink and then i drink chicory with almond milk 2x per day,,,,i know the teeth thing too mine are just a mess....not sure why this happens but finding ways to get out bodies back to normal is crucial! so far this has been working....  Hi abbie and I'm sorry that you are having such a lousy time.You can try tonic water for the nausea; it contains quinine, which is wonderful for settling the stomach. Peppermint helps too. for the bleeding gums, get some horse chestnuts, when they are about later in the year, and make an infufion of them/ Avery small sip, rinsed quickly through the teeth and gums will help strengthen the blood vessels in the gums. I used it once and never had any more trouble from bleeding gums. It's very very bitter, so have something nice to take the taste away straight after, but it does work very well and very quickly. This was recommended many years ago on TV by the great David Bellamy, in his series 'Bellamy on Botany' when telling us that an infusion of horse chestnuts is a cure for the 'Farmer Giles', cockney rhyming slang (of course) for piles. I used it successfully for them too and never had any more problem. It seems to be good for both ends of the digestive system, so maybe it would help anyboy with bleeding in the stomach, but I wouldn't like to drink it! ReadAvoid milk and eat an apple to reduce reflux. Nobody can guarantee anything will work, but in your state any help is better than none! Good luck, and as you can't get conkers until late summer, there is a cream preparation available that contains horse chestnut and you should be able to get it from the usual store. Oh abbie, I'm so sorry that happened to you. I'm also in the middle of this LPR struggle that sometimes push me to the edge. What I learned however is to be super strict with your diet. Choose only bland alkaline food that are soft to the stomach. Observe small frequent meals strictly also. Probiotics helped me and some digestive enzymes. It also helps when I go slow walking with the morning sun to increase your vit.3 levels. I do this while taking famotidine, an H2 blocker because I have adverse reaction to PPI especially omeprazole which made my throat really sore. Hang in there and pray.  Hi Abbiie, I'm sorry you feel this way. ;-( Now, I don't really know how to help you or even relate to your problem but I have a couple of suggestions. First why are you taking PPI's if they are not helping, or are they? You need to get a 2nd Endoscopy and depending on the results consider surgery or stretta therapy after they do that 2nd Endoscopy. I see you have been taking PPI's for some time now, you could be deficient in many vitamins so I suggest you take Calcium, Magnesium, B12 (or B Complex liquid or sublingual) D3 and K2 right away, I mean like yesterday (ASAP).

          "I'm not entirely sure whats going on with my body any more.. (Diagnosed with gerd, gastritis and hiatal hernia after endoscopy a year and a half ago) I've changed my diet completely. Sleep raised in bed. Do light exercise 5 days a week.. basically before someone suggests these sorts of things I have tried everything that I know of. I've been on pantoprazole for a year and was on omeprazole for 5 months prior. Completely changed my diet. Haven't touched alcohol nor a cigarette in 18 months. I don't eat anything deep fried.. No onions no tomato absolutely nothing spicy. Actually pretty much all I can eat is bread, potato and some veg and some fruit. I can barely eat meat any more either. Anything I eat burns my stomach when it goes down, my stomach burns for hours after.. then I get that infamous 'gnawing pain' which wont go away until I eat. Anyway, about 6 months ago 2 of my teeth crumbled away, I've only had the fillings in for about 5 months and they are both brown and stink.. Im sure its due to reflux.. My gums bleed every time I brush my teeth, no matter how soft the toothbrush is. They even bleed when I eat food. A couple of nights ago my throat became inflamed, it burns even when drinking water. It feels like there is pressure in my throat near the top of it. It hurts to swallow.. my tongue is coated with yellow stuff. My mouth is dry. My breath absolutely stinks and has done for months, even before the teeth incident. I'm always nauseous. Some weeks I'm only getting about 10 hours sleep over the entire 7 days because all these symptoms keep me up. My gp is at a loss.. they don't really listen to me anyway. My consultant at the hospital makes me wait a whole year for my next appointment, thats after the last one had to be brought forward by my gp calling him and telling him it was urgent.. He saw me for 5 minutes, said I had reflux.. gave me some anti sickness then asked me to leave. I'd already been diagnosed with reflux and given anti sickness by my gp? Guys, I'm only 20 years old.. I'm 20! I was never ill before this and now my entire life has been turned upside down by something my doctors seem to think is 'simple'. It's past the point of effecting my 'quality of life'.. it has literally taken my life away. I can't do anything anymore. I'm always in pain, feel sick or am being sick. If you got this far down and managed to put up with all my moaning then thank you, If anyone has any idea what is going on with me then please feel free to comment.. Also, if there is mistakes in here or it doesnt make sense in parts, I've had 1 hour sleep in 48 hours so I'm not at my grammatical best right now!"
