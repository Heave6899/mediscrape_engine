          " <p>Hi Penny, doesn&#39;t sound remotely like perforation to me. (I&#39;m a former nurse btw.) Perforation would cause sudden unbearable pain, and you&#39;d collapse in shock.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of reasons why this could be going on. I&#39;d say you can afford to wait for your doctor to call back unless there&#39;s any serious deterioration.</p> <p>Hi Penny</p><p>i hope you&#39;ve had the call and has put your mind at rest. It doesn&#39;t sound like a perforation I don&#39;t think. More likely the after effects from the scope the procedure itself, the air that is blown inside to aid viewing and maybe biopsies. It should settle over the next few days. It can be quite traumatic for some people and that obviously has an impact on how you feel afterwards. Rest and recover and hope all is well.</p> <p>My throat was was very sore two days after my EGD so I think that is normal but not sure about chest pain. If it doesn&#39;t go away I&#39;d call your doctor</p> <p>Sorry to ask but I have same thing as you after endoscopy day before yesterday. Did your pain go or did you see your doctor or have to go to A &amp; E. I&#39;m really scared it&#39;s caused something and I don&#39;t know what it could be. I&#39;m calling my doctor tomorrow though. </p> Hi penny! i am hoping you will see this as i am having similar discomfort. I had an upper endoscopy, and right after i was fine and had a smoothie, however, i went and had lunch where i ate bread and i think that was a really bad idea...because from then on (its been 2 full days) i have had a strange discomfort in my chest behind my sternum, especially when i breathe in deeply. when i swallow i have the hardest time getting it down so i am discouraged to even eat. even swallowing water hurts...it feels almost as if I have taken a large pill and it is stuck (even though i havent). i cant tell if its gotten better since the procedure because i havent eaten much. is this similar to whar you felt?"

          " I have not yet had one... but have heard from many that feel \"off\" for awhile after... the prep alone can make you feel \"iffy\" for awhile... maybe load up on the probiotics for awhile... and I think they sometimes pump air into your colon to see stuff better... that can leave you bloated and gassy... The major threat is perforation or infection... so watch your poop for blood and call the Doc if you start running a temp. Otherwise, ride it out, you will feel better. :-) I have had 4 or 5 colonoscopies and afterwards i alway felt fine . I had one 2 weeks ago and I have had cramping, sharp abdominal pain, heartburn and nausea ever since. Three days ago I complained to the doctor and he sent me in for x-rays. Later that day I started having chest pains and along with nausea and some pain in my left arm I thought it was probably a good idea to go to the ER and make sure I wasn\u2019t having a heart attack. I wasn\u2019t, it was probably a panic attack worrying about a perforated bowel or something but while I was there they did bloodwork and a CAT scan with dye and couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with me. \u8def I'm at a loss They just want to treat the symptoms at this point  My first 3 years ago was fine, got a couple of polyps, no sedation. My repeat 3 year checkup last week {6 days) was a bit more uncomfortable, again no sedation but i'm left with a slightly bloated feeling, that doesnt seem to shift. Not phoned back yet but its a little bit worrying"

          " <p>Hi Jen,</p><p></p><p>It will be all the air they pumped into your stomach to open it up during the procedure. It can sometimes hang around for a couple of days, causing a lot of pain. Occasionally, the biopsy can cause a bit of residual pain too, especially if it was taken from the oesophagus.</p><p></p><p>Danger signs are &quot;coffee ground&quot; vomit, or black, sticky, foul-smelling diarrhoea. Both of these are signs of internal bleeding but are very rare after endoscopy. If you don&#39;t have these signs, then don&#39;t worry about it, the pain will soon ease.</p>  Hi. I am hoping that you receive this because I see the strand was from about six months ago. I just had an endoscopy yesterday and I am feeling all of the symptoms that you previously mentioned. The doctor is saying it is normal, but I have had endoscopies before and have never felt this way. Did your symptoms subside? Was there a bigger issue for you or was it simply just discomfort after the procedure? I appreciate any feedback! Thank you.  Hi I had an endoscopy today and and 8 hours later my throat is very sore even from just drinking water. I also have a pain in my chest especially when I take a deep breath or move around. I have mild stomach pain but this I am putting down to air which was pumped in. Just really hoping it won\u2019t last to long  <p>I had chest pains/pressure for a week after my endoscopy and extreme discomfort swallowing. It felt like there was a sore that was being scraped every time food went down within a couple of seconds of swallowing. I called doctor&#39;s office after 3 days and the receptionist / nurse seemed concerned and said to call back the next day, but when I did another receptionist told me not to worry and that it&#39;s common to last for about a week. This was after having had an endoscopy several years previously with absolutely no after-effects and the doctor telling me there should be no discomfort at all after the procedure. Anyway, after a lot of freaking out and worrying, 8 days later the pains did eventually subside and then disappear.</p> <p>I just had an upper endoscopy this morning. Everything seemed okay until later this afternoon. Now it seems every time I swallow I am getting 2 separate pains in my chest (or esophagus?) as whatever I swallowed makes it&#39;s way to my stomach. It happens every time I swallow anything - including saliva and water. Chest seems very sore too. Is this normal? Should I call the dr? I&#39;m concerned. Not sure if it matters, but I know he took some biopsies..</p> Hi Jen, I had the upper endoscopy 5 days ago and now I can still feel the back/chest pain at night, it prevent me from falling asleep and very annoying. I went to the urgent care clinic 2days ago, the doctor told me I have GERD, now I'm taking omeprazole and anti acid liquid, which can make me feel better but still can do nothing for my pain at night, is the pain you are having getting worse at night? Hi! I Also have pain following my endoscopy.. It has been about 4/5 days since I gotten the procedure yet my chest/back still hurt very much. It feels like there is something stuck in my chest which makes it very hard to breathe. I can't drink, eat, or even swallow without feeling the pain in my chest. I also have the constant need to burp with this pain. I am very uncomfortable and sometimes the pain is extremely bad. I was wondering if this was normal and I should wait it out or if I should get help i just had an upper endoscopy two days ago the day of the procedure i felt no pain but yesterday and today have felt mild pressure/chest discomfort i am considering going to the ER since its a weekend night i worry more than i should i just am concerned something is wrong the pain isnt severe but its there seems to be right where my stomach and esophogas would meet "

          " So my CT scan shows my Hernia is back ! Ugh . Still waiting on Upper Endoscopy. I\u2019m having heartburn still two months after my nissen fundoplication. My dysphagia problem still there because I got 360 wrap. it\u2019s not as bad as it was in the first two months , it\u2019s starting to show improvement in the last couple days where I don\u2019t need to drink water as much while I\u2019m eating but, I still have a ways to go. I read that post operatively it takes about three months for symptoms to really resolve I\u2019m praying that that\u2019s true because my heartburn was just bad before I went in and now it feels like it didn\u2019t help at all. I had Hiatal hernia 2 cm, some Barrett\u2019s esophagus and gastritis from what the endoscopy revealed and I had my Nissan fundoplication on February 26, 2020 so it\u2019s still fresh. I hope you get better I feel your pain and agony I know it\u2019s it\u2019s very frustrating and messes with our quality of life it\u2019s unfortunate I\u2019ll pray us both. Welcome to Connect @faithincrisis. Sorry that you are still experiencing issues, but I am glad that they are beginning to clear up. I know @marianna1968jt had her Nissen Fundoplication in January. It sounds as though this surgery is causing a lot of problems for people. What is your biggest hurdle right now? In reply to @faithann64 \"So my CT scan shows my Hernia is back ! Ugh . Still waiting on Upper...\" + (show) @faithann64 I am so sorry to hear of the return of the hernia. I hope you are able to find some help. Have you considered a second opinion at a Mayo facility or another multi-disciplinary medical center (like a university medical school)? My scans are normal except for a small stable lesion on my pancreas and extra air. The pain in my left side is off and on but always sore. If I eat 3 regular meals, not big portions, my left shoulder throbs and so does my left side. That's the hurdle trying to overcome. No heartburn. Hi @faithann64, I would love to know if you have any updates since we last spoke. Are your symptoms still consistent?

I had a follow up with my surgeon on March 7th a week after my fundoplication and had a ct scan the same day. my wrap was fine no slipped hernia or wrap being loose. My surgeon said that it\u2019s most likely phrenic nerve irritation from the laparoscopic surgery it can mimic heartburn, pain in the chest, and also referred pain in the shoulder from the gas left from the surgery. He told I should not have to take my ppi medications anymore so I stopped taking them. About two weeks later the heartburn, chest pain started returning not as bad in pain terms but enough to make me feel uncomfortable again. maybe 3-4 times a week In cycles. I contacted my surgeon again and he sent me to do a barium swallow on April 8th. The results were no acid was coming up into my esophagus to cause the heartburn and my wrap was tight and intact. I told the doctor administrating the test I have what feels like heartburn still. He believed me that I have pain and discomfort, but that it wasn\u2019t because of acid coming up from my stomach because the wrap was blocking it. My surgeon has referred to another GI doctor to find out if we can get to the bottom of this. I have my appointment on 5/12/2020 in a couple days. Sorry for the long reply I hope my punctuation is good. Some better news is my swallowing has gotten way better in the last week, I can eat better. Still not 100% but it\u2019s improved. I hope they fix your hernia quick @faithann64 I haven\u2019t lifted or done anything strenuous since feb 26 2020 for fear of hurting my wrap or having slipped hernia. Thanks for all the replies. And hope you all heal soon. Mine feels more like sharp stabbing to throbbing pains. At times I feel a bump on my left side. When I had GERD that was more of a burning sensation which gave me an esophageal ulcer. If the barium swollow doesn't show anything then they will do an upper endoscopy. been dealing with this since the surgery in January. In reply to @amandaa \"Sending good vibes and prayers your way! Let us know the outcome.\" + (show) So I had the upper endoscopy earlier this morning and it showed I have severe Esophagitis ! ( Inflammation that damages the tube running from throat to stomach ) UGH. Caused from either stomach acid backing up or infection ?? So the surgeon took biopsy's and just waiting to here from him on the next step of this unfortunate process 1 year after surgery This has been going on for sometime now and i'm hoping it can be fixed ???? I\u2019m sorry to hear about the esophagitis. Good thing that they found something and now most likely they can fix it. Although I\u2019m taking back because if you have the nissen fundoplication This is supposed to prevent acid from coming up from the stomach to the esophagus. I\u2019ve been hearing that stress can cause acid to rise and just stress does a bunch of bad things and makes the hormones in your body go haywire. I\u2019ll pray for you and I hope things get better for you buddy. In reply to @faithann64 \"So I had the upper endoscopy earlier this morning and it showed I have severe Esophagitis...\" + (show) That does sound very painful, but I am so glad they found the problem and can start a resolution for it.

I am so glad to hear that you had the upper endoscopy and that your doctor found the problem with your swallowing issues. As @amandaburnett said, it is good that they found the issue so that a treatment plan can begin. I thought you might find the following discussions on Connect helpful from others who are dealing with issues with their esophagus. Here are the links, https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/esophageal-problem/ https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/esophageal-motility-disorder-dont-know-what-to-eat/ Were you given any diet recommendations or will that come after the biopsy results?

I had a laparoscopic Nissen in 2014 and open revision with hiatal hernia repair in 2015, I have been having swallowing difficulties, some GERG and occasional regurgitation recently. I had an EGD which reveled esophagitis and it was also noted the nissen appeared loos and there was a small hiatal hernia. I am concerned as the surgery in 2015 was very difficult but concerned it may be headed that way. I am just wondering on others experiences and if there were other options i can consider or should I begin to prepare myself psychologically for another surgery In reply to @diamae \"I had a laparoscopic Nissen in 2014 and open revision with hiatal hernia repair in 2015,...\" + (show) Hi @diamae and welcome to Mayo Clinic Connect! I am sorry you are dealing with these issues after your surgeries. You will see that I moved your post to a discussion about exactly what you were talking about.

I have a follow up with GI pending and rereferal to the surgeon also pending In reply to @diamae \"I had a laparoscopic Nissen in 2014 and open revision with hiatal hernia repair in 2015,...\" + (show) I had my surgery back in April of 2019. I've had , I think 4 or 5 upper endoscopys . Each time it shows inflammation and like the 3rd one it showed a small hiatial hernia . Each time he stretched my Esophagus. It helps for awhile?? I still have problems swallowing and allot stomach pain but each time my surgeon says he can'take really pinpoint why. I hafta really chew my food and take small bites. Even drinking liquid hurts. It has eased up somewhat . The only good thing that came out of my nissen fundoplication and hiatal hernia surgery is that I don't have acid reflux anymore. Definitely get ahold of your surgeon and explain what's going on. Good luck ! @faithann64 @diamae I had a botched Nissen in 2016 in Central Iowa.. to reduce GERD, was the reason.. but 2 months later and a 50 pound weight loss Mayo Minnesota found that I had post operative gastropareses\u2026 The Mayo GI Doc said it could not be reversed.. they gave me a way to cope and I have gained back 40 pounds plus.. I have to watch carefully every day to eat small portions\u2026 cut very small .. I snack a lot.. nuts, dried fruits in trail mix works \u2026 Be careful not to recline after eating\u2026 Gravity has to work to empty the stomach.. Sleep with the bedhead raised at least 6 inches\u2026 otherwise up the food comes.. I cannot eat leafy greens unless pureed.. or chopped up very small. Soft breads do not work.. Cabbage and Broccoli don't work unless again chopped very small\u2026 those things ball up and come up.. Vomiting is much easier than it used to be but spreading a meal over an hour or so.. is necessary to give the stomach time to empty\u2026 The bloating can be painful.. but I chew a few Papaya enzyme pills and that takes care of the reaction of too fast and too much food down there\u2026 Ken In reply to @ken82 \"@faithann64 @diamae I had a botched Nissen in 2016 in Central Iowa.. to reduce GERD, was...\" + (show)   Mine was April 2019. Had Hiatal hernia surgery and Nissen done ,,,,And yes small bites and watch what you eat . I still have problems swallowing and allot stomach pain. When I mention this to my surgeon he basically just shrugs his shoulders and says he doesn't understand why ???? Like I said I've had numerous upper endoscopys since ( surgery ) and each time he stretches my esophagus. And there's always inflammation and another small hernia. The only good thing that came out of all of this is I don't have acid reflux anymore. With mine i can't vomit anymore. If I do its what's in my esophagus, no stomach contents. Since surgery I've been diagnosed with IBS and take diffrent kinds of meds for stomach . Ugh. Constant battle all the time. I hafta watch what I eat and it's almost impossible to go out and eat , if I do i hafta be carefull . And yes I have the bloating also. I've told my surgeon many times that something doesn't feel right and his reaction is always the same . I see also my Gastrolologist regular and he tells me that my surgeon is one of the best ? I wish you good luck. I had a Lap NIssen in 2014 with open revision in 2015. I have been having increasing symptoms over the past year. Recent EGD found esophagatis, 24 hour PH testing had DeMeester score: 73.2 with 16.9% total ph <4 and 30% when supine. They are doing a barium swallow this week and then follow up with surgeon. I am hoping to avoid another surgery but with symptoms and feeling so miserable I am thinking that surgery is likely the right way to go. Wondering if anyone has had a failure this far out and if a subsequent surgery resolved issues. Looking for any experience to help decrease my anxiety. Thanks in advance!! In reply to @diamae \"I had a Lap NIssen in 2014 with open revision in 2015. I have been having...\" + (show) Nissen's often relax over time, requiring additional surgery's. I have a perfect Nissen and it was the worst decision that I have ever made in my life. I have been on 2 facebook forums for 2 years now that talk about your specific question. One is just called Nissen Funduplication Facebook and the other is Nissen Funduplication take down Facebook. On the take down page have seen that some people after the 2 or 3 failed nissen convert there nissen into a gastric bypass and are very happy. You may want to post your question on the take down page because this is where most people are having complication after a Nissen. I'm sure that you will find the support that you need. Good luck to you and I'm wishing you the very best. In reply to @diamae \"I had a Lap NIssen in 2014 with open revision in 2015. I have been having...\" + (show) I had this surgery in 2018 and now have a failed Nissen. I had an open surgery. I spoke with a younger surgeon regarding a redo surgery. After several tests the surgeon told me that he could do the laparoscopic surgery, but could not guarantee that there would be an improvement even after the surgery because the original surgeon made such a mess of it. My HMO did not want me to have the redo so I am left with the long term effects of a botched surgery. I am able to control the discomfort by small meals, sleeping on my left side to facilitate movement of stomach contents, diaphragmatic breathing exercises. Not the perfect answer, but it helps. In reply to @faithincrisis \"Thank you for your reply\u2019s @faithann64 and @amandaburnett . I had a follow up with my...\" + (show) What happen and how are you now? Omg I have had the same problem. I had 1 Nissen's in 2014 then I have had to have EGD every 3 to 4 months!!! I had it undone and redone but looser. Anyway been ill with chocking, upper GI pain, weight loss. Anyway we came south fir the winter. Been sick still. Had to find a GI here and last week I had an EGD and he said that my Nissen's wrap has slipped and is under my diaphragm. The reason for my hiccups is i have a hiatal hernia! It was fixed. So going home next week to have a chest xray and who know see a surgeon! Ahhhh Take care my friend and get yourself fixed!

          " I am wondering why at such young age, what is your symptoms buddy?  Apologies, I was genuinely sympathetic. Best wishes  Hey, feel free to have a read of mine should answer most questions you have. Regarding perforations in the colon you can check stats yourself online but from memory it\u2019s something ridiculously small. I wouldn\u2019t overly concern yourself with it. First of all whoa, the other person was only trying to help. No need to be so aggressive. You will have sedation (should you chose and i recommend it). You will be awake. Good Luck <p>I&#39;ve had two in the past two years both with sedation, which I recommend. I can&#39;t remember a thing about the first one as it was a combined endoscopy and colonoscopy, and for that procedure they usually administer more sedation so it knocked me out. The second was a colonoscopy only, and even with sedation I was fully aware of what was going on, and watched everything. It is only a mild sedative and some don&#39;t remember a thing, but it should only be enough to relax you, which I was. Judging by the actions I witnessed of the surgeon performing the procedure, he was not hanging around and seemed to be putting in quite some physical effort into the procedure. With that in mind I can imagine your insides are quite strong and resilient to physical contact, and therefore very difficult to perforate, as was already suggested to you by Carolannes&#39; reply here stating ridiculously low rates of complications. The most pain I got was from my colon being blown up with air, which has to be done to so it&#39;s easier for the doctor to view your colon. I recommend passing wind as often as you can, it eases a lot of the discomfort.</p><p>To be honest, I&#39;ve always found the bowel prep to be the worst part of the whole procedure, it gave me horrid cramping pains, made me really sore, tired and drained and was a real onslaught on my whole body, make it through the prep and the rest should be plain sailing.</p> Hi I have had 6 colonoscopies over the past 14 years...and never had a problem with the procedure itself. As for the sedation i didn`t really notice any effect but it must have relaxed me a bit..i was nowhere near falling asleep. I even watched on the tv screen the scope go round my large bowel. As for perforation risks i have been quoted the risk odds, by Doctor`s, ranging from 1 in 800 to 1 in 8000..!!!. You say you are not concerned about the prep...this is the worst part!!....stay near a toilet, drink lots of water..and follow the special diet to the letter. IF you don`t they won`t be able to complete the procedure. Hope all goes well...regards <p>The answers posted to your questions are very honest and I think reflect the experiences of most of us. The last colonoscopy I had the surgeon said risk of perforation is one a thousand.Previous colonoscopies the stats were not given to me. As far as sedation it depends on the surgeon, several I&#39;ve had I have been very relaxed and awake and could have looked the screen had I wished. The last one, different surgeon, I awoke after it was all over feeling like I&#39;d had the best sleep ever.</p><p></p><p>The prep is more uncomfortable than the procedure. That also depends on the surgeon which prep they advise. Having only liquids for a day is boring and spending the evening in the bathroom a bit draining but it is over soon. Like everything else in life anticipation is 90% of the ordeal.</p><p></p><p>I am aware of young people and children of acquaintances who have had the procedure but have had no first hand conversations re their experience.</p><p></p><p>Ask your surgeon or Doctor all the questions you have re their protocol on sedation.</p><p></p><p>A good question I don&#39;t see addressed much is about your diet for the first few days after the colonoscopy. In my experience and that of some others a light diet is best for awhile.&#160;</p>"

          " I've had loss of appetite after taking antibiotics. I'd have to force myself to eat soup and toast or something light. From what I remember it would take a few days for my appetite to return, but it was a gradual process. Don't eat anything fried or spicy. A colonoscopy didn't seem to cause this for me. I think taking probiotics will help. Hope you're feeling better soon! Gas is pumped into your bowel during a colonoscopy and this can cause gas and bloating. It is an invasive procedure which can disturb the bowel. If you had sedation, this can also cause nausea, anxiety and depression. The bowel prep can also cause disturbance too. Watch out with anti depressants. They can cause excessive weight gain because they can give you a ravenous appetite. While they can help with sleep, they can leave you drowsy during the day when you would rather not sleep. Since you are finally feeling a bit better, it may be that it will just take time for your bowel to settle down again. If you are still concerned, speak to your doctor about your reactions. I took me three weeks to recover from an endoscopy because I was intolerant the sedation. I reported the problems I had and was fobbed off that the reaction was unusual. I know this was untrue because I read that the severe depression I developed is a common problem."

          " If you mean one going in from the bottom end, I had one without sedation. It wasn\u2019t too bad really, the upper one was worse without sedation due to the \u2018gag reflex\u2019 having to swallow the camera. I watched them do it on the monitor, and the worst bit is when they go round a bend in the colon, but it was more discomfort than pain. If you ever have an upper one (I\u2019ve had several done, and felt it went much better with sedation than the one without) I\u2019d suggest you have sedation particularly if you have a strong gag reflex. Hope it all goes well for you. <p>I had a sigmoidoscopy about 15 years ago, which only goes about 1.5 feet in, far less than the 5 feet or so a colonscopy goes.&#160; I had it without any sedation, as it wasn&#39;t offered, so I just assumed that it wasn&#39;t bad, and that since doctors do them all the time, that I assumed they know what they are doing.&#160; BBBAAAAAAD&#160; assumption.&#160; It was beyond painful.&#160; I will never go back for anything like that.&#160; I have no family history of cancer, and none of the risk factors associated with colon cancer, so I assume the risk.&#160; Yes, I am in the US where the colonoscopy is run like many other associated corporate money makers.&#160; I have no trust in the doctors here, which is rather odd because I worked in health care for decades of my life, but corporate ameriKKKa has taken over health care here big time.&#160; Doctors are merely employees of large corporate entities now.&#160; Yes, great health care is available, to those that have cold plated insurance policies ...... otherwise, it is buyer beware.</p> <p>Hi Lisa,</p><p></p><p>I had my colonoscopy with sedation - it was recommended due to my age (27). I&#39;m returning for a sigmoidoscopy around March and they&#39;ve recommended no sedation which I&#39;m happy to trust them with given my previous experience. I would take the advice of your doctor (or if you call the number on your booking letter they should be able to discuss options with you). If they&#39;ve recommended it then I wouldn&#39;t advise skipping it!</p> If this is your first one, I think it is impossible to know whether or not it will be tolerable, because it will depend on how you are made inside, and what conditions they find. Many people find the experience uncomfortable but tolerable, and say the prep is the worst part. At my 1st colonoscopy it was discovered I had a longer than normal colon which was narrowed and had extra twists in it. (The written report I was given described it as thickened and tortuous). Additionally I had diverticula right on some bends. There was no way anyone could have known in advance as the procedure in the UK is colonoscopy 1st, CT scan 2nd. Even though I was sedated I do vaguely remember crying out in pain and they had to abort the procedure as there was too great a risk of perforation to proceed. A 2nd attempt was an even greater failure and the consultant had the sense to stop almost before he started. Also this time the sedation had no effect whatsoever. I was finally given a CT scan. If at all possible I do strongly advise you to find someone who can act as your driver, so you can have sedation if necessary. I look forward to the day when this procedure is replaced by swallowing a small camera and the results processed after it comes out the other end. <p>You will be fine without sedation- I had my First las November and hate being \u2018out of control \u2018 .so opted for no sedation. &#160;I was very nervous too.&#160;</p><p>There was only 3 times when it was a bit painful, but I just shallow breathed through it. The Dr was lovely and took great care and talked all the time. I watched it all on the screen and it was quicker than I thought. There is gas and air on hand if need be. I had two biopsies taken but didn\u2019t feel that .&#160;</p><p>The worst is the prep- vile stuff and so much to drink in one go.&#160;</p><p>I really hope yours go well too.&#160;</p><p>Let us know. &#128522;</p> <p>I&#39;ve got &#160;mine tomorrow. I&#39;m not sure if to just go for gas and air</p>"

          " Hi, I've had very similar symtoms for nearly 2 years.. I'm interested to know why you're having your pancreas scanned? Did a blood test indicate that there could be something wrong with it? I've not had mine scanned nor has it even been a suggestion. I have pain right around the left side just under the rib cage which is worse when there is more passing around my bowel (including trapped wind).. I wouldn't worry about having a bowel movement every day, I sometimes don't have one for 5 days and the doctor isn't even concerned about that. Some people just have lazy bowels. I did hurt my back in summer 2014 trying to move something really heavy and something gave in that area but it seemed to get better over time (at least that's what I thought). I've had abdo CT, abdo mri, kidney ct, kidney renogram, heart ct, chest xrays, 2 colonosopys, 1 camera down throat, numerous blood tests and nothing discovered to date yet the discomfort persists. Lower left sided pain could def be colon. Maybe there is some inflammation....hopefully not an IBD though. The dark bowels indicate bleeding high in the digestive track so you may have an ulcer. The bloating and pain could also be caused by an Ovaraian cyst or tumor. Just throwing different things out there to consider. I read that a lot of ovarian issues are missed because people think they are digestive issues. However, your loose dark bowels to me indicate that it's probably something high in the digestive system (stomach, duct, or pancreas) The H.Pylori test was wise. If that comes back positive, I would guess that it is a ulcer. This would explain the pain, and the dark stool (possible blood in the stomach). Ulcer pain could be radiating down to your lower left side as well. Please follow-up, and post your H.Pylori test results. From WebMD What Are the Symptoms of an Ulcer? The symptoms of an ulcer include: Burning upper abdominal pain, particularly between meals, early in the morning, or after drinking orange juice, coffee, or alcohol, or taking aspirin; discomfort is usually relieved after taking antacids Tarry, black, or bloody stools Bloating Heartburn Nausea or vomiting Early feeling of fullness"
