          " Has anyone had experience with using the drug Domperidone for chronic nausea? Hi @jacque6977, As you probably know, Domperidone is not available in the United States, but it is widely used in other countries; for example, whenever I visit family in Bombay, India, Domperidone is what we take for nausea or even queasiness. Although not for chronic nausea, @emeleen @konagirl have discussed taking Domperidone, for digestive issues, and I hope they will return to share their experience. @jacque6977, do you have a specific question regarding this drug? In reply to @kanaazpereira \"Hi @jacque6977, As you probably know, Domperidone is not available in the United States, but it...\" + (show)  For four years the medical profession has been unable to diagnose the cause of my wife\u2019s chronic nausea and fatigue. Domperidone is being given to her for a ten day trial. I realize the drug is not available in the US, but it can be purchased in Canada. In reply to @kanaazpereira \"Hi @jacque6977, As you probably know, Domperidone is not available in the United States, but it...\" + (show)  I tried it in 2009 and paid $34.00 month. It was becoming costly with my other medications and not covered under US Health insurances. It did work but my EES works just as well and is covered. A friend of mine \u201cfinally\u201d was diagnosed with gastroparesis (felt she had it for years), and was placed on domperidone but shouldn\u2019t have. First, it is from Canada (not under our FDA and technically we are not to buy across country lines\u2026even though used in Europe and Canada about 30 yrs and very good) but her cost is $700/month and her friend\u2019s at the pharmacy I used, is now up to $500/month she said. My friend is elderly and has a cardiac pacemaker, tears in her aortic arch and congestive heart failure. All \u201cNO\u2019s\u201d for domperidone\u2019s usage. She did not get a paper with side effects but, her daughters and I looked on the computer and she was shocked. My brother-in-law had 2 pharmacies that compounded it locally for him (they did it for years) but they discontinued doing it. He now obtains it from Canada and does help him a lot like it did for me. I do not remember his cost but I don\u2019t believe it was that high. I could be mistaken. The USA should manufacture it. In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) My grandson is only 19 years old and he has this. He takes protonix and watches his diet. I\ufe0f was very surprised someone so young has this. Our family has a history of bad stomach problems. Also diabetes. He does not have diabetes. In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) I do. I took Propulsid for it for about 3 months before they took it off the market in 2000. It worked well for me. My doctors do no not think I am a good candidate for Reglan. I have a little bit of neurological problem\u2026 just a tic. In 2013 I tried Domperidone and I had side effects, but I cannot remember now what they were. After 2 weeks I discontinued them. A gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville FL prescribed the Domperidone for me and I had it filled a local (Albany GA) compounding pharmacy. You might want to try it for a couple of weeks to see if it is for you. It was long ago, but I think they were pricey. If they work it would be worth it. I eat no raw vegetables or fruit except ripe bananas. Too much fiber at one time can slow my stomach emptying more. I eat soft cooked vegetables, and fruits, and tender meats. I had to have gastric bypass to fix a paraesopageal (sliding) hiatal hernia in 2014. My stomach only holds about a cup of food. So I eat about ever 2-3 hours and throw some high calorie cookies in there to get my calorie intake up to maintain weight. I do like those Lorna Doones though. More suggestions on food here: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gastroparesis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355792 . I also have achalasia and Barrett\u2019s esophagus. I take the generic of Prilosec twice a day. In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) It has been determined that since I have the rare FGFR3 ANTIBODY which is the cause of the Peripheral Neuropathy, it is also the cause of the Gastroparesis since this is caused by the nerves but working properly in the stomach. In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) How did you find that out? In reply to @nanny23 \"How did you find that out?\" + (show) @nanny23 They did a gastric emptying study. You eat a small meal, which usually involves eggs and toast.. sometimes they add bacon.. that they put a little radioactive material in so the camera can follow the food as it goes down the digestive track. It has been a few years since I had the test, but think a scanner took a few pictures and then after a certain time a few more pictures were taken.. long enough to sit a while in a waiting room between sessions. An upper endoscooy was done around the same time.. I think a week or so before. There was undigested food found and a small bezoar. With me they do not know what caused me to have gatroparesis. In reply to @nanny23 \"How did you find that out?\" + (show) @nanny23 Nanny, at this point I can only add a bit of info. One of the docs who did my endo mentioned that this is common as a side effect of several forms of neuropathy. That is, when whatever you have that will bring neuropathy gets into one of two places, the esophageal valve system or the sensori-control nerve, it can make the valves inoperable or inefficient. There are several disorder which can do this, such as various forms of Amyloidosis such as Crohn\u2019s, Multiple Myeloma, Light Chain, Gelsolin, any kind of misfolded protein. Also, of course, diabetes, cancers, simple nodules on the valve system. When they checked me for muscle movement, they found that some of the tubing was not moving quite as it should when I gave the command to swallow, or cough, or whatever. That would probably be the neuropathy, it seems, as I have neuropathy all over my body. Maybe that is why the doc calls me \u201cPsycho\u201d. In reply to @nanny23 \"How did you find that out?\" + (show) I have neuropathy in my legs could I\ufe0f possibly have in my stomach also? Thank you so much for your reply Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot use the Reglan as it is a bad drug in my opinion. I can tell you that it caused me to go into major depression in 2008 In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) @nanny23 Any place you have nerves, with or without muscles. In reply to @nanny23 \"How did you find that out?\" + (show) @nanny23.. Hi. Same for me. My feet, legs, a little in my hands..it will progressively spread too. Our stomachs use nerves to digest our food. The nerves not working properly contribute to the outcome of Gastroparesis. For me, it is most likely caused by the FGFR3 ANTIBODY so I would not be idiopathic (meaning unknown cause). For until it was discovered that I have this overabundance of this bad antibody, I was told my reason for having Gastroparesis was unknown. Darlia In reply to @nanny23 \"How did you find that out?\" + (show) What is FGFR3 antibody and how did they find out you have it? Does that mean you have an autoimmune disease causing this? Thanks for replying. In reply to @nanny23 \"How did you find that out?\" + (show) Hi @nanny23..Ihad blood work sent to the Washington University in St. Louis, MO by my neurologist. He contacted me when it came back about 5 wks later. He told me that it was positive for the FGFR3 antibody which is a bad antibody gene. He said there is no way to know how it became so high or when it started. It could have been from some trauma. I have had trauma most of my life so, that\u2019s going to remain a mystery I guess. Normal # should be less than 3,000 and mine is 14,000. So, without any other cause so far for the gastroparesis, it would be suspected that this is the cause. This antibody causes neuropathy. If you go to my post on the FGFR3 Antibody, you can read more about it. Be safe out there! Darlia In reply to @nanny23 \"How did you find that out?\" + (show) I do not believe that FGFR3 is caused by an autoimmune disorder. However, I DO have autoimmune disorders separate from the Peripheral Neuropathy. In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) Hi @darlia, We have several discussions about gastroparesis which you may wish to view: \u2013 Does anyone else out there have gastroparesis? https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/hi-all-does-anyone-else-out-there-have-gastroparesis/ \u2013 GERD, gastroparesis, neurogenic bowel https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/gerd-gastroparesis-neurogenic-bowel/ \u2013 Failed Nissen w/gastroparesis & possible MALs https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/failed-nissen-wgastroparesis-possible-mals/ I\u2019d like to invite @katmandoo @citygirlannie @faycarole @clemlaa @debnjay @galy @jlfisher56 @robatk17, to join this discussion and share their insights as well. The Mayo Clinic link provided by @fourof5zs above, (thank you!) also has some great information about ongoing research and studies to investigate new medications to treat gastroparesis. In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) I have idiopathic gastroparesis and am pre diabetic. In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) I was told I had gastroparesis after I had surgery for a hiatial hernia operation 3 years ago. I have taken too many medications to count. I\u2019ve also tried every diet with no success. I was told my vegas nerve was damaged so my digestive system no longer works. I have learned to live with it. I have lost a lot of weight and I have no strength left. I hope you have better luck. In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) So sorry you are not well. I have many stomach problems too and nothing seems to work for me In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) Perhaps we can all pray for relief for one another. Until medicine catches up with our IBS or other serious stomach there is limited options. My heart goes out to all who are suffering pain today. In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) I have idiopathic gastroparesis and don\u2019t have diabetes. I tried Reglan and didn\u2019t work plus my Dr told me to stop it because it can cause Parkinson\u2019s. I had a gastric pacemaker implanted in my stomach which has leads that go directly into my stomach to stimulate it so I can eat and the food will digest. I have to eat several small meals and avoid raw vegetables, fruit, nuts and high fiber. Also only eat chicken, fish and hamburger. I have had the pacemaker since April 2012 and it\u2019s a life saver. Hopes this helps you. Kathy In reply to @katmandoo \"I have idiopathic gastroparesis and don't have diabetes. I tried Reglan and didn't work plus my...\" + (show) I\u2019m glad to hear that the pacemaker is successful. I m not to that point YET! But I did take Raglan from 2007 till 2010 approx. It contributed to clinical severe depression and I weaned off in 2010 when a friend who also has Gastroparesis educated me that she\u2019d read that Raglan could CAUSE depression. She said she would continue to try to control it with diet. So since 2010 I\u2019ve struggled with it and attempting to use diet as the only control. I don\u2019t always succeed. Recently now I saw a new Gastroenterologist and she seems very educated on it. She is suggesting an Endoscopy at which time she would inject Botox to open up the sphincter and cause the food to empty quicker. Has anyone else ever heard of this or had it done? Darlia In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) Yes I had the Botox done 3 times before it quit working for me. It would last about 4-5 months. The last one didn\u2019t work at all that\u2019s why I got the gastric pacemaker implanted in my stomach. In reply to @katmandoo \"Yes I had the Botox done 3 times before it quit working for me. It would...\" + (show) Wow! I thought it was a brand new treatment. Now I\u2019m wondering why the dr\u2019s didn\u2019t suggest it prior. In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) When you did use the botox treatment I am wondering about that. 1. Are there any side effects? 2. Complications or issues later on? 3. Does the botox make it so you no longer have a. Acid reflux b. Regurgitation c. Can you eat more variety? 4. Does the Pace maker make it so you\u2019re eating more\u201dnormal\u201d? And are there any problems with the pacemaker? Thank you!! Darlia In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) I recommend the pacemaker. In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) a friend has it and doesn\u2019t have diabetes. she is on reglan. she already had depression before starting it. I am trying to help with diet etc. In reply to @pendragonart \"a friend has it and doesn't have diabetes. she is on reglan. she already had depression...\" + (show) Welcome to Connect, @pendragonart. We look forward to getting to know you. Do you have gastroparesis? In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) I eat several small meals a day, but sometimes the food just sits in my stomach. A walk usually helps. I also gently massage my stomach to help stimulate it. I lay a microwavable heating pad on my stomach when it gets painful and do more gentle massaging. My doctors advise me not to take reglan. I tried the domperidone (may not be spelled correctly) and I had several side effects and it was no help for me. Propulsid did work, but it went off market shortly after I started taking it. What works for one person may not work for another. Sometimes you deal with several differrent conditions and it makes it difficult to figure out what will work for you or your loved one. In reply to @pendragonart \"a friend has it and doesn't have diabetes. she is on reglan. she already had depression...\" + (show) no I don\u2019t have it but a dear friend almost certainly does, and I have been trying to help. she has had every sort of test I can think of done due to her crippling condition and nothing else shows up. I told hewr reglan is risky but she has lost so much weight and is malnourished from it. has no other options that they share with her so I came here. In reply to @pendragonart \"a friend has it and doesn't have diabetes. she is on reglan. she already had depression...\" + (show) @pendragonart If she has not tried domperidone I would recommend she try it before reglan. I had to go to a compounding pharmacy for it. It does not have side effects that are permanent like reglan. I have other issues that contribute to me trying to maintain weight and was not causing the problem I had when they tried me on it. Liquids or pureed foods and low fiber also help. If her gastropareis is severe her best option may be the pacemaker. In reply to @pendragonart \"a friend has it and doesn't have diabetes. she is on reglan. she already had depression...\" + (show) she is on reglan. I just told her about the domperidone and pureed foods. she couldn\u2019t go to thanksgiving dinner because of her stomach and bowel issues. she is miserable always feeling like she needs to \u201cgo\u201d and cant. yes she is avoiding fiber. In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) When I first was having problems with my idiopathic gastroparesis they put me on Reglan. My family Dr told me to stop it because it can cause Parkinson\u2019s disease. I\u2019m doing quite well on the pacemaker I\u2019ve had since April 2012. In reply to @pendragonart \"a friend has it and doesn't have diabetes. she is on reglan. she already had depression...\" + (show) I think there are many good ideas in this discussion that she should talk over with her doctor. It sounds like her problem is severe. The pacemaker may be a better option for her. It may depend on what other digestive problems she has.. and it sounds like she may have more than gastroparesis (I have no medical training.. I\u2019m just guessing). I deal with 4 digestive diseases myself and many in this group deal with more. Finding a diet that works all the time is impossible. There are bouts of constipation and diarrhea. I wish her the best and pray she finds help soon. In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) Yes it can. I was on it many years and started having 6 months of terrible shaking, and almost the inability of writing my name. Then .a black box warning just came out stating the severe side effects you mentioned and that they may be permanent. I tried domperidone from Canada which helped but then used the erythromycin that my insurance paid for (125 mg 4 times a day as a prokinetic\u2014stomach contraction). I was lucky that all the shakiness abated but took many months. It is very serious. AS a nurse, we used to use it on infants who had reflux. I never knew it had such severe side effects and like I said, I took it at least 6 or 7 years before it became so bad. NEVER again! Tardive dyskinesia is a horrible side effect that I have had patients with and I thank God I did not get that. The uncontrollable shakiness was enough. It almost was to the point I had to sign an X. My neurologist was so thorough always reviewing all my medicines and was the one who found the NEW alert! In reply to @jlfisher56 \"Yes it can. I was on it many years and started having 6 months of terrible...\" + (show) with domperidone, CHF is not to be used by the way! Just a side note. A friend of mine is using it and has CHF and a pacemaker but the alert states not to use if heart failure. That is the problem with some of our doctors and getting medicine from Canada. She is paying $800/month and a friend told her of another pharmacy for $500/month. Erythromycin is an antibiotic that used in a low dose is a prokinetic,,,contracts the stomach muscle. Best of luck. In reply to @fourof5zs \"I eat several small meals a day, but sometimes the food just sits in my stomach....\" + (show) botox worked great for my gastroparesis. I had it down to the lower sphincter in the stomach and that way, when the food gets there, a hole is always open allowing it to enter the small intestine. Botox is injected into 3 small areas of the muscle. With stomach contracting so slow, by the time the food reaches the bottom, the muscle is closed. Food can collect and \u201crot\u201d causing infection. Botox keeps the muscle slightly open allowing food to exit in small amounts preventing this. I had it done January 2014. The daily nausea and vomiting are gone and excessive weight loss. I still have limited foods I can eat but NO pacemaker. Botox is still working and is a blessing. I use liquid erythromycin (granules) to make my stomach contract and eat small meals. My vitamins are gummies or chewables and foods must be easily digestible. Breads have to be white (refined) nothing that takes long to digest causing further problems. A wonderful dietician helped me. I am not diabetic and it was caused by medications. As an RN, I never had encountered it. My case was/is severe. The botox really saved me. Best of luck! Joan In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) Hi All: I have been reading with interest your discussions on gastroparesis. I have had 3 surgeries of the upper digestive tract and 2 of the surgeries were invasive. Since the second surgery, I certainly have a lot of the symptoms of gastroparesis, with feeling full quite quickly and feeling nauseous if I go beyond the full feeling. I noticed that some of you have mentioned walking after eating and I realized that exercise was probably a good idea. As a result, I \u201cGoogled\u201d exercises for gastroparesis and found some very interesting, easy to do exercises that don\u2019t require walking outside. These are to be done after you eat. I\u2019ve tried both of them and could notice feeling better without so much of that bloated, full feeling. I just wanted to share it with you in case you would like an alternative treatment. Here is the link, http://www.diabetes-book.com/exercises-facilitate-stomach-emptying/. Have anyone tried other exercises after meals? If so, will you share your experiences?

I am very careful about my diet. I avoid any raw fruit or vegetables. I also try to eat a low fat and low fiber diet. I have low energy and depression as a result of this disease. It has changed my life. I used to travel extensively but now I am limited because of dietary needs. I have learned to live with this but it is a challenge!

At that time my vagas nerve was damaged so my digestive does not work anymore. At the same time I had a fundoplication and now I have heartburn and have to take Nexium every day. I wonder if you could tell me about the gastric pacemaker you had implanted. Could it help with my digestion? Ann In reply to @darlia \"Looking for suggestions on diet, alternative treatments, etc that are being used by others. I cannot...\" + (show) I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis which is not related to diabetes and it is not clear what causes it. I also was offered that horrible drug and declined it. I tried many fermented foods (that helped a little) and always questioned the doctors if I have a low acidity in my stomach. To my surprise they couldn\u2019t test it and actually were prescribing me medication to lower the stomach acid. Since I was feeling worse after prilosec and similar drugs, I started to do different home tests to see if my stomach acid is insufficient. Turns out \u2013 it is. Some people are just born with it, and some people acquire this disease as we age. Then I found this mineral water Mineral Water Essentuki No. 17. Make sure to take Essentuki No. 17 and not No. 4. I drink a few sips of it 30-40 minutes before food intake. So I go through less than 0.5 L bottle per day. I can not believe how much my symptoms improved. Not bloated anymore. Still have some air pushing out (belching) but pain is also mostly gone. One thing \u2013 I lost 15 pounds when I started this water and I was in normal weight. Probably because the food started to move faster. I am so happy I finally found what helps me after 2+ years of suffering. Try it. You can find it online. Good Luck!

It was confirmed with gastric emptying test in 2015. I don\u2019t vomit, but the nausea is moderate to severe. Zofran, nor phenergan was helping anymore. I was put on marinol and i now have relief from the nausea. Finally, but marinol takes some getting use to as it is synthetic Thc. It gives you a (high) feeling, but your body adjust to it.

I was diagnosed with Gastroparessis in 2014 and I'm in Raleigh, NC. I have tried many medicines including Reglan, Erythromycin, etc. I currently rotate between Zofran, Benadryl, and Phenergan for nausea. I was recently diagnosed with Jackhammer Esophagus and I'm waiting on my appointment for Botox injections\u2026 I have been looking to get the Pacemaker but no doctors here in NC actually performs the procedure. I've lost weight, had to have a port placed due to my veins not being accessible due to dehydration from vomiting so much in the beginning. I do have a few questions, feedback is greatly appreciated. Does anyone know of any GI specialist that will do the initial consult over the phone? Has anyone had their insurance cover traveling cost to go out if state to see another specialist or to have a procedure done such as the Pacemaker or G-Poem surgery? Could someone please provide some of their best GI or Gastroparesis specialist? I'm at the point where if I need to travel for a resolution I will. My last gastric emptying study was in 2014 should I request another one or can doctor's use the previous test? Thank you all in advance for your feedback. ***Aetna is my current health insurance*** In reply to @aishia \"Hello All, I'm new to this thread but I must say so far I ha e...\" + (show) Greetings Aishia, Thank you for your imput on your personal experience with Gastroparesis..I empathize with your story too. I can say that it is an ongoing battle that doesn't have any ending for sure!. In answer to your ? about the stomach emptying test\u2026 you only need it one time to determine how long it takes your nerves in your stomach to digest, I was told by my Gastroenterologist. I originally had it done in 2007. If anything, the symptoms will get worse over time as we get older. I have found that diet is the best option. I am not taking Zofran or any of the other drugs I had taken in the past for nausea either. I have found that drinking tea made from natural things like Ginger root and Basil leaves will help with symptoms. I grow my own Basil too and then dry it to have it on hand. Excersize too helps as was mentioned by another member prior. Some times I experiment with eating a food that I was told that I shouldn't eat and it will be okay. I think it depends on other things going on as to if it will make me sick or not or be tolerated. That's so weird I think but thought I would pass that on as it has happened. Like raw lettuce, Romain, I can tolerate once in a while. I do a lot of smoothies and have found that using a Super Food of dehydrated veggies, fruits, probiotics and vitamins mixed with coconut or almond milk, ice and banana or strawberries or powdered peanut butter in the blender is very good!. I buy it at Walmart in the vitamin section and it comes in a canister and I have found that the cocoa flavored one is good because then you don't have that green algae, alfphalfa flavor thing to deal with!. It makes a great smoothie, I have it as a meal because it is so big and I get 50 items in it at once as is listed on the packaging. I live in NE Missouri and the Gastro Dr I have wanted to do the Botox on me but I said no because it only lasts for 6 mnths. I hope you get a good Dr. too. I know that it is not easy to deal with daily and if you haven't had a good dietitian, I would recommend that too. Just Keep Swimming, Just Keep Swimming! Stay safe!

I also have lower extremity neuropathy. If anyone like myself is having chronic nausea with no relief go look up (Marinol.) It is synthetic THC and it works very well.

I agree depending on the day what I eat may or may not agree with my stomach. I found it strange they requested another study although the two I had shows my GP to worsen. I use smoothies and tea as well. I have just started using dementia and Black Walnut natural herbs. I am always trying different combinations of things. Sometimes I can due tuna and crackers but once my body seems to become immune to something after while it rejects. Everyday is a challenge, but I refuse to sink so I must keep SWIMMING.

In reply to @aishia \"Hello All, I'm new to this thread but I must say so far I ha e...\" + (show) I have written in about all my situations that give me awake and asleep problems. I have seen a urologist and gastroenterologist and tried medications. I also had surgery by an ear-nose-throat doctor. I have hiatal hernaia, acid reflux, IBS, Hemerroids, urinary urgency, anxiety, osteoarthritis. Whenever I list all this stuff, I feel sorry for myself so I hate to say it. It makes me face my reality. Newer medications for IBS and urinary urgency are quite expensive. They didn't help that much so for a few days I am trying life without them. I have gotten meat stuck in my esphagus. I believe that was the nutracker esophagus you were describing. I have glaucoma too. In reply to @aishia \"Hello All, I'm new to this thread but I must say so far I ha e...\" + (show) I went to Omaha, NE to get my gastric pacemaker implanted. I live in Kansas and was told of three places closest to me to get one. They were Omaha, St. Louis and Wichita. My insurance did not cover my mileage but the pacemaker has been a God send. I had it implanted in April 2012. My Dr told me not to take Reglan because it can cause Parkinson\u2019s disease. I also got the fundiplication wrap and I wouldn\u2019t advice to get that because I was miserable and he accidentally cut my spleen and it had to be removed. My gastroenterologist recommended these places so maybe find a good Gastroenterologist in your area to help you. Good luck and get better, I did. Kathy In reply to @aishia \"Hello Darla, Thank you for the feedback. I agree depending on the day what I eat...\" + (show) Wow that sounds exactly like the same thing I'm going through and have been going through since childhood! I've multiple spinal injuries including scoliosis and severe anxiety, a little bit depressed but mainly because of the chronic pain. Also I was pushed out of a moving car at the age of 1, luckily we were turning a corner. I suffered a very minor head trauma concussion and was sent home. It was so minor that even my father doesn't know about it. My mother and my grandmother died due to esophageal issues but when my grandmother died in 1999 they said she had rare growths in her lungs. In 2010 when my mother died, at the age of 58, they said the same thing about her at first but she ended up with necrotizing pneumonia and died 1 week later. I've also been very emotional since childhood and my pupils get large especially when I was a child. I also have fibromyalgia. My current psych doc ordered me to go to counseling, I had several traumatic things that happened to me since early childhood. Another psych doctor several years ago asked if I had head trauma as a baby because I had a seizure at age 25 due to orthostatic hypotension. He said people in their mid-20s reported having seizures after head trauma as a baby. I have Bodelekies (wrong spelling, another so-called rare disease) hiatal hernia and according to my research it's from blunt trauma and neurological issues. Almost everything, I've read here, I have including dehydration and I drink lots of water! I'm heading out today to get blood work.

I don't know of trauma to my body, but the doctor induced my mother's labor and later said he guessed wrong on my due date. I was born at least one month early and had no eyelashes or fingernails and my digestive system and breathing had trouble because they were not mature for birth yet. My mother said she had to keep sticking her finger down my throat when I was a baby and she'd pull out flem so I wouldn't choke to death. I took pills for anxiety for quite a while and they didn't seem to help and they slowed my reactions and I had some car accidents so I won't take them any more.

I don't eat very much to begin with but I kept getting very sick, pneumonia/bronchitis/dehyration etc. My electrolytes kept dropping down so fast causing confusion and making me so sick. Between 2016 & 2017 I was in ER 17 times, with 7 admissions. Gastroparesis reconfirmed again early 2017. I kept telling 2 gastros, my internist, a \"specialist\" that I paid out of pocket seeking a diagnosis; telling all of them the same thing, I couldn't hold my food down, not even the gastro diet, my stomach hurt all of the time, I was vomiting 4-6X week. That I was trying different foods in small amounts but It didn't matter. I told them I was belching so badly that I couldn't sleep, that I was hiccuping constantly that hurt. The hospital, along with these doctors all ran labs, labs all positive for dehydration and electrolytes. Stopped going to doctors & ER. Sick & tired, literally. Have been bedridden over 2 years. Finally, after 4 months, my husband insisted on taking me to a clinic outside hospital system. The clinic had access to all my records. PA diagnosed me within 15 minutes \u2013 severe malnutrition due to gastroparesis. Saw a new Gastroenterologist, tested me, gave me hope but I was unable to take Domperidone. He said I was so sick that he had to send me to Tampa. I'm seeing another Gastroenterologist on March 23 & a surgeon on March 27. I am scared. I am so sick, I have no energy. The pain is unbearable. I am being told I need surgery. Does anyone have any advice to give me? I'm on a liquid diet and drinking Pedialyte but I'm vomiting that presently also. Thank you so much.

There are times when the pancreas becomes so stressed that you don't get the typical extremely high liver enzymes (lipase and amylase) that point to pancreatitis. That also causes gastroparesis because your body is not producing the enzymes needed to digest your food which also leads to malnutrition. I would hope there is an easier to combat explanation, but your symptoms are identical to someone suffering from either acute or chronic pancreatitis.

I cannot...\" + (show) I'm getting an upper endoscopy April 5 to confirm gastroparesis. I had to cancel my last one a few weeks ago because I tried cleaning out for almost 3 days and nothing was moving. I told my doc when they do the next one next month that I absolutely do not want my esophagus stretched, it's only been stretched once so I'll remind him again before they give me the anesthesia. I was just prescribed amlodipine besylate a low dose calcium channel blocker for my Nutcracker esophagus. I've only been taking it about 5 days but I asked the doctor please prescribe until after I get the upper GI test results. I will look up this other so-called rare antibody. I'm on mostly a liquid diet right now and I'm dropping weight really quick. My blood work is great except I'm low on folic acid and vitamin D. I read about esophagitis eosinophilic people are low on vitamin D, I also have disc desiccation in the thoracic spine and I'm assuming that's one reason for my neuropathy plus the cervical injuries and my low back with bone on bone. Hopefully we can get this figured out soon!

Surely they are going to check again after you\u2019ve been on the liquid diet for a while. And your gastroenterologist should be sharing all of this with your GP. If you don\u2019t think your gastroenterologist is doing everything possible to help you, maybe you need to look for a different one. Good luck to you! In reply to @montgomery41 \"Hi everyone!

I follow this Digestive thread but I lurk most of the time and I...\" + (show)    Hello @montgomery41, I found some information from Mayo Clinic regarding new treatments (under investigation) for gastroparesis, and though I'd copy relevant points that might interest you: \u2013 One example is a new drug in development called relamorelin. The results of a phase 2 clinical trial found the drug could speed up gastric emptying and reduce vomiting. The drug is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but a larger clinical trial is currently underway. \u2013 A number of new therapies are being tried with the help of endoscopy \u2014 a slender tube that's threaded down the esophagus. One procedure used endoscopy to place a small tube (stent) where the stomach connects to the small intestine (duodenum) to keep this connection open. \u2013 Gastric electrical stimulation is a surgically implanted device that provides electrical stimulation to stimulate stomach muscles to move food more efficiently. Study results have been mixed. However, the device seems to be most helpful for people with diabetic gastroparesis. \u2013 Gastric pacing also involves a surgically implanted device that stimulates the stomach muscles, but this device tries to more closely mimic normal stomach contractions. Currently, the device is too large and causes discomfort. Gastric pacing devices are only available in clinical trials right now. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gastroparesis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355792 The above link also has details about two current Mayo Clinic trials that you may wish to view. I'd like to reconnect you with @jlfisher56 @kamg @aishia @katmandoo @xcinsanx @harliegirl, as they've discussed similar issues \u2013 I hope they will join this conversation and share their thoughts about talking to your doctors. In reply to @kanaazpereira \"Hello @montgomery41, I found some information from Mayo Clinic regarding new treatments (under investigation) for gastroparesis,...\" + (show)      Hi there is this gastric pacing you on about is the pacemaker you talking about or something new Hi everyone! I follow this Digestive thread but I lurk most of the time and I apologize. I apologize, this may be a little long. If anyone is going through this and have any insight please share your thoughts/comments. I'm 41 y/o. I've had GP and the Vagus Nerve Damage for several years now. Anything I put in my mouth, food and/or fluids I end of vomiting the majority of the time. I've tried several different medications for the GP but none of them really helped. I had my first EGD with Botox injections back in April of this year which after about 2 weeks it seemed to help with the n/v to where I gained weight. I had my second round of Botox injections this past Thursday so I hope this helps. My GI specialist commented on my EGD results and said there was old food lining my esophagus and stomach and she was unable to remove it to see my abdominal lining. It sounded like the old food was like placque build up from old food. I have had more EGD's performed but none of them showed something like this. I am now to follow a full liquid diet and if that doesn't work then I'm looking at getting another J-tube placed. I also have an appointment with another specialist to talk to me about the gastric pacemaker. My abdomen hurts so bad I'm doubled over all of the time and my GERD is so bad even though I have to sleep in a recliner and not next to my husband the reflux is free flowing up my esophagus and out my mouth and nose causing painful sores in the corners of my mouth and in my nose. I had a Heller Myotomy in 2006, which is where they removed the lower section of my esophagus, which a typical person has a sphincter there to prevent food/reflux from going back up but with that procedure that sphincter does not work. I'm constantly nauseated and vomiting/retching. I don't know how to explain these things to my general primary doctor or the doctors in the ER because they don't have a clue as to what is going on with me. My pain is real and noone wants to address it. I was on a pain regimen but my PCP cut me off cold turkey and refuses to prescribe pain medication to me any longer. Can someone give me some insight on how to plead my case to physicians who aren't that familiar with my conditions? Thank you so much for reading this. God bless! Michelle In reply to @hgarm \"I know you are never supposed to Google your symptoms but because the doctors don't seem...\" + (show) Hi @hgarm, about six months ago, I had my 3rd allergic reaction to my 3rd RA med (older school, DMARD's) Sulfasalazine, which then began another odyssey or maybe avalanche is more apt, in my health issues. But my GI Dr. & her PA (around here you ONLY see the PA or CNP in-office). SYMPTOMS, PROCEDURES & TESTS \u2013 here we go: \u2022my first symptoms were EXTREME abdominal stomach pain, it was lower than normal, right about center of my tummy. \u2022It was even more severe than the 2 bouts of Epiploic Appendagitis I've had. \u2022I started drinking Pepto (or generic) a LOT, like way too much. Which gave me terrible, impossible constipation. Other symptoms included: \u2022Extreme nausea \u2022Vomiting \u2022Unable to swallow much of anything\u2026and then keep it down. \u2022Weakness, overwhelming fatigue. \u2022My acid reflux went crazy also, we tried all the usual stuff \u2013 tilting the bed, propping up on pillows & more, until I just finally started to sleep upright in my hubby's comfy chair. \u2022I've lost over 30 lbs & I CAN NOT exercise, due to my many pain-related issues. \u2022The first test by GI Dr. ran was an upper abdominal ultrasound (to see if I had any blockages, tumors etc. I came up clean, only with enlarged bile ducts. \u2022Then I had an abdominal ultra-sound. \u2022Next, was a MRI of my abdomen with contrast. \u2022And the last one I had was 2 wks ago, an upper abdominal endoscopy w/ultra-sound. As for me, I've been instructed to eat small meals about every 2.5 hrs. That has helped & now it seems most of my day is involved with taking pills at exactly the right time, eating at the right time, etc. THINGS THAT HELPED: \u2022My doctors doubled my PPI meds (Lansoprazole also avail OTC); \u2022they added another med (Rinatidine) 2x a day \u2022Smaller meals \u2022STOPPING the Pepto!!! I'm a moron & of course I did not even consider how severe it would make constipation. \u2022Slowed waaayyy down on Tums, cause I kept eating them to keep the acid reflux away (also can cause constipation). But say, 6 tums after a half bowl of oatmeal. Then if I do get reflux right away, I'll have another 2 or 4. \u2022Limiting (not really by choice) what I (can) eat to things like: oatmeal, bread, yogurt, protein drink. NO: chocolate, caffeine, juices\u2026most everything else (for me). \u2022My DH finally broke down & got me the adjustable base & a new Tempurpedic mattress. UP NEXT: \u2022I should share that I do take a lot of meds, the GI Dr. & her PA (the Dr., Whom I ONLY see for about :30 seconds before & after procedure) have always mocked & chastised me for \"all the pills\" I take \u2013 including pain meds, which are managed by a pain specialist (MD). So the Dr. had the diagnosis made up in her mind \u2013 *Gastroparesis* \u2022My PA had been telling me that a 'Gastric Emptying Study,' & a colonoscopy where what I needed to do to ?confirm? \u2022FYI the treatment is to stop, permanently, all my pain meds; all anxiety neds & 1 depression med. I have major PTSD, which I noticed in the past 6-12 mo, is really is really being triggered. Probably about all the handling & pain inducing procedures. So anyway, since my mom committed suicide when i was 18, you might see my hesitation to stop some of these meds. \u2022Finally, on Tue., when I met with the PA in office, he said that they thought the 'Gastric Emptying Study' wasn't really necessary!!! !!! WHAT ?? !!! I did a search on the Mayo site & the said \"the most important test in diagnosing Gastroparesis.\" I hope this helps. Get to a GOOD GI Dr. asap. Where U live, there is only one GI group within 60 miles.

The test that confirmed this was a gastric emptying test. My symptoms were major weight loss at first (from a size 12 to a 2) in about 2 1/2 months. I also could not eat many foods without experiencing some adverse reaction such as constipation, nausea, dizziness, etc. I lived in about 3 foods for over a year of which were bone broth, organic turkey and yams. I\u2019m also a POTS patient so it was difficult healthwise. My histamine levels rise rather quickly with almost everything so I make a lot of items myself (cleansers, cosmetics, etc) and I have to watch my foods carefully. I would suggest you ask for a gastric emptying test. In my case applesauce took more than 5 hours to move. I now have SIBO and am being tested for MALS. My physician is trying to see which began first. I hope they are able to get to the bottom of it sooner for you. In reply to @hgarm \"I know you are never supposed to Google your symptoms but because the doctors don't seem...\" + (show) yes, my daughter had Gastroparesis and was treated at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. She was treated by Dr. Camalari, however not sure if he is still there, but you could certainly check.

Again barely eating anything do to pain after eating and just generally feeling like very weak and in pain In reply to @hgarm \"I know you are never supposed to Google your symptoms but because the doctors don't seem...\" + (show) Discomfort in upper abdomen which is very hard to explain. Not pain really, more like a heavy, uncomfortable feeling. Realized later on, it was probably bloating that I was experiencing. I lost weight because I was so anxious about not knowing what was wrong, and when I had episodes of discomfort/bloating, I stopped eating. My GP was diagnosed with the gold-standard test, Gastric Emptying. That was 2 years ago. I'll be happy to answer any questions. I felt very alone in my journey to self-help. There is no cure for GP and no explanation for mine. It's a \"motility\" issue possibly caused by damage to the Vagus nerve. Your stomach does not empty in a timely way, allowing food to sit and rot, and also resulting in early satiety. I recently joined a GP group that you may find helpful: Inspire.com Good Luck.

But I, too, have pain issues from multiple back surgeries following an injury 26 years ago, as well as fibromyalgia and the autoimmune disease, Sjogren's Syndrome. I was recently diagnosed with Gastroparesis after a year of vomiting and stomach pain, not being able to eat\u2026you know the score. Anyway, I have an implanted device that delivers dilaudid to a place in my spine that was injured after a car accident AFTER I'd already had a spinal fusion and I take additional pain medicine for breakthrough pain. It makes doing the test for gastroparesis impossible because it would be positive regardless, but after a year of every test under the sun, the doctor feels very confident with his diagnosis and I'm doing really well with the smaller meals and a combination of the gastroparesis/FODMAP diet. My gastroenterologist has never suggested I go off my pain meds or the other medication I take for my other conditions. While I've been cutting back some on my oral meds and I want to talk to my pain doctor about what I might be able to do to cut back with my pump, my gastroenterologist seems to understand that my pain is a part of me and he's treating me as a whole, not just as a stomach. Since you have major PTSD as well as pain, is it possible to talk to another doctor who would treat the whole you? Again, I'm not a doctor, I just hate to see anyone have to choose which disease they're going to have treated, That's totally unfair. I understand there's some give and take, but as a fellow pain patient, I can sympathize when someone tells you, that's it, stop your pain meds. Right, and while I'm at it, I'll go back 26 years and undo the injury, it's about as likely. I've definitely been able to cut mine back, but getting rid of them overnight is never going to happen. I wish you the very best. I know there is a whole lot I can do to help make my disease better and I'm doing all I can every day, but it helps to have a doctor who's working with me and all of my warts. I hope you get the support you deserve for all that you're dealing with. All my best, Tracy In reply to @hgarm \"I know you are never supposed to Google your symptoms but because the doctors don't seem...\" + (show) Nausea and vomiting all the time. It got so bad I started vomiting up any liquid.I was diagnosed December 2018 and have lost 16 pounds since then.I can only eat unsweeten applesauce or canned peaches without sugar and infant lemon flavor pedialyte to drink to be able to take my other medication.Everything else that I drink or eat results in vomiting even drinking water. Im on zofran which helps a little and reglan 3 times a day and 10,000mg a day vitamin D3 my calcium is 10 and im on prescription iron pills 325mg once a day for 6 months now and my iron is always between 8 and 10. My parents said as an infant I always had a vomiting issue and could only drink goats milk. As I got older stomach problems continued and I was put on a medication called \"Milkinol\" it was in a brown bottle and it was white like milk. it coated my stomach and tasted good .I would have to take it 30 minutes before eating 3 times a day from age 4yrs to age 12.After that I was always a picky eater because my stomach hurt all the time this was in the 70's in Alabama so going to a Gp wasnt an option.I was always very skinny and anemic with brittle nails and osteoarthritis in all my joints.So now the Gp said its probably always been gastroparesis.This has been a lifelong battle with stomach problems. I know you are never supposed to Google your symptoms but because the doctors don't seem to know what's going on with me I figured I should give it a try. After googling my symptoms gastroparesis popped up saying that my symptoms resemble it. Seeing as the symptoms online seem very vague I was hoping someone who Has it or is suffering from it could tell me their symptoms? I am currently dealing with severe stomach pains when eating, diahrea that seems so be slime like and yellow, a feeling like something is stuck in my throat by my chest and feeling like I'm going to vomit it up. Some days are way worse than others but right now I can't eat and it's caused me to loose over 22 pounds in a month. What were your symptoms before you got diagnosed?

Symptoms were mild at first, but gradually got worse. I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy and those did not show anything to warrant my issues. Severe nausea, fullness without eating, no appetite, pains in stomach, side, back, lower intestine, constipation/diarrhea, weakness, exhaustion, no energy. My follow up appointment with GI wasn't for 3 weeks, and I ended up in the ER. The ER doctor ordered, CT scan to check pancreas and liver. That's how he discovered gastroparesis. I have been living on Boost and Powerade. GI doctor ordered the Gastric emptying study and that showed it was Severe. I tried drinking 3 Boost a day, taking 3 hours to drink each one and sipping Powerade throughout the day, about 30 ounces. I haven't had solid food for over 3 months. I have more bad days than good\u2026 Blessings, Darlene Hello @darlenemeeder and welcome to Mayo Clinic Connect. I'm glad that you found this patient support network. I'm so sorry to hear about your digestive problems. Not having had solid foods in over 3 months is certainly difficult. I'm assuming that you have lost a lot of weight. We have many Members who deal with this diagnosis. I will invite them to post to you about their experiences, @rossjt, @ken82 and @fourof5zs. I see that this was diagnosed in the ER.

The feeling of wanting to help, but being unsure of where to start. I moved your questions regarding instructions of where to begin to an ongoing conversation about gastroparesis in hopes to connect you with other members who are facing the same diagnosis. Perhaps they can lend some tips on things that family members did to help them. I also wanted to share the caregivers group with you in case you would like to connect with others taking care of family and friends. https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/meet-fellow-caregivers-introduce-yourself/ Do you know what your daughters current symptoms are? Does she have regular GI care? Gastroparesis in itself isn\u2019t life-threatening, but it can cause life-threatening complications. The exact cause of this disease in unclear, yet it\u2019s believed to stem from injury to the vagus nerve.Have any Dr's talked about looking into doing any kind of bypass surgery? The vagus nerve controls stomach muscles. High blood glucose from diabetes can damage this nerve. In fact, may people with gastroparesis also have diabetes.Does your daughter have diabetes? I'm so sorry, that this distance, is a problem, I understand this only too well, as I live in FL. and My kids are in MA. I'm here for you. @karjack, thank you.. I will talk to her about this.

I cannot eat soft breads, broccoli, cabbage, yogurt and others\u2026 but what meat I eat for protein I have to have a gravy or a sauce with it\u2026 even if it is applesauce\u2026 bar-b-que or such.. things I eat must be cut up very small.. I use a food processor /blender often.. With gastroparesis gravity must come into play to empty the stomach.. so one has to keep the body as vertical as possible after eating \u2026 I can put my feet up .. but I have to sleep with a big wedge propping up my body trunk so the residue of the stomach will not come up in the night\u2026 Every meal is a challenge.. eat often and in small amounts.. crackers, small bites of cheese\u2026 Mayo Scottsdale is a good place to go\u2026 (during the winter some of the doctors from Minnesota look forward to going to AZ\u2026 Good luck..

I also now have gastroparesis, probably caused by 5 abdominal surgeries in 13 months, so I too have to be careful about what I eat, how much, how fast etc. If I eat too much it causes major nausea and I vomit. Thanks for the tip. I'll try it. Hi I\u2019m a single mom who has struggled with GI issues since my son was born. When I would eat or try to eat healthy I would end up in the bathroom for 4 hours vomiting and having diarrhea until everything was out of my system. The only thing that helped was fasting. Everything I ate I had a hard time digesting . Scopes removed a colon polyp and upper indicated esophagitis first then several months Later gastritis. They prescribed ppi\u2019s but that made the pain worse. Then I started to experience dehydration in my hands, weakness in my arms and legs , fatigue , nausea, constant belching , diarrhea. I\u2019ve had CT , ultrasound , hida . All show Fatty liver but normal. Literally everything I eat I feel like I\u2019m having an allergic reaction! Any ideas? @petal285 \u2013 Welcome to Mayo Clinic Connect! How long has this been going on? How old is your son? Have you lost much weight? I understand why you are afraid to eat- My first thought reading your story was Allergy. Are they planning to evaluate you for it? As well as Celiac disease? In reply to @petal0285 \"Hi I\u2019m a single mom who has struggled with GI issues since my son was born....\" + (show) @petal0285, I would like to welcome you to Mayo Clinic Connect. I am sure that dealing with these GI issues every since you had your son has taken away from that experience. Having to end up in the bathroom for 4 hours vomiting and having diarrhea until everything is out of your system has to be exhausting while caring for a young child by yourself. You will see that I moved you inquiry to an ongoing discussion about GI issues and there are several members that have very similar issues and stories. https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/gerd-gastroparesis-neurogenic-bowel/ I did this so that you could connect with them and share your experience. @thull, @ken82, @darlenemeeder, and @pdilly have all had GI issues, and although you do not have a diagnosis as of yet, I am hoping the conversation that following with fellow members with help you to arrive at one with the help of your medical care team. @petal0285 May I ask, how old is your son now? How long have you been struggling with this? In reply to @petal0285 \"Hi I\u2019m a single mom who has struggled with GI issues since my son was born....\" + (show) @petal0285 My late Mother would tell me that I was such a big baby that I moved her stomach. She had to be very careful how and what she ate. I developed Gastroparesis after a Nissen Surgery that was supposed to reduce GERD instead it damaged the hairnet like system of nerves that empty the stomach. I have written many times in the past so please look back at those hints.. The really important issue is to eat very small portions cut up very small of anything what works. My Mayo MN GI Doctor had to prescribe a anti-depressant (Mirtazapine) that would help me realize I had to eat. I have been on that and a Nexium Generic to reduce stomach acids for over 4 years. It is no fun to feel your best in the morning when waking and you are then faced with eating the rest of the day and evening to survive and thrive. I do not know where you are located, but you need to see really good GI doctors. Good luck In reply to @jlfisher56 \"botox worked great for my gastroparesis. I had it down to the lower sphincter in the...\" + (show) Did you only need botox once? If not how often do you need it? @beansforthepoor .. I've had gastropanesis since 2015.. Mayo MN diagnosed it.. as \"post operative\" in that it was caused by surgical damage to some of the nerves that make the stomach contract and move the food on into the GI system.. I've not heard of if botox would benefit this condition.. it takes 3 to 4 hours to empty the stomach now.. my biggest problem is that when I am hungry.. I tend to eat too fast.. and some of that comes up shortly after the \"gobble \".. even ice cream with strawberries.. in my race to not let the ice cream melt\u2026before eating..chilling the bowl helps.. and amount control is mandatory.. the quandary between how much you want and how much you can keep down is key..

Kindly share please because am in dire need of assistance, please. In reply to @ubikings \"Hello @nanny23, I have same challenge, please kindly share how you have been coming with it...\" + (show) I try to eat spinach and other roughage to help me pass food quickly. Sometimes nothing works. Warm prune juice works. Hi all \u2013 I am brand new to this group and they think I have SIBO and gastroparesis. The diets are COMPLETELY OPPOSITE of each other. How screwed can one get? Just finishing a course of antibiotics for the SIBO and then will have the eating test for the gastroparesis. Been totally healthy all my life until the last couple of years. ALL vitals are super healthy, so I have no idea what might have caused this. The bloating/distentension and constipation are the worst. @jfar007, hello. I hear ya about opposite diet. I have kidney disease so have eliminated meat from my diet and most animal products (including most dairy) though I do eat eggs for the protein and have to limit whole grains. But I also have Type II diabetes which does call for whole grains and good fiber and limited carbs. Yet this conflicts with my diet for gastroparesis which limits fiber (thus eliminating many vegetables as a source of protein such as beans and nuts.) It's quite a balancing act. I received very little help from local dietitians with my renal diet so designed my own and after almost no help from the GI peeps have had to design a compromise diet which balances the three diets the best I can. Fortunately my local hospital is revamping its dietary department and is hiring \"real\" dietitians who are experts and will be offering one-on-one consultations early 2023. But I've already discussed my \"compromise diet\" with one of the new dietitians and it seems I'm on the right track. I will post what I find out later on but meanwhile I hope you can find a doc or dietitian who can help you balance the opposite diets. In reply to @kamama94 \"@jfar007, hello. I hear ya about opposite diet. I have kidney disease so have eliminated meat...\" + (show) Wow you definitely have more of a challenge than I do. Thank you for sharing \u2013 its just kind of depressing we have to learn to just accept it. Thanks so much for reaching out In reply to @kamama94 \"@jfar007, hello. I hear ya about opposite diet. I have kidney disease so have eliminated meat...\" + (show) Can you please share some of the foods that you can eat? I have SIBO, GP, and Kidney disease, with diabetes and IBS-D. It sure is a balancing act. Never know what will agree with me and also be healthy. I eat a lot of cold wild salmon, shredded chicken and egg salads, tuna fish, shrimp, scallops, cod, rockfish, oysters, lots of fish. Butter lettuce and berries. I just discovered sugar free apple pie, which has NO potassium!! Tried kale last night and I was in the bathroom all night. Argh\u2026 In reply to @mrssdr \"Can you please share some of the foods that you can eat? I have SIBO, GP,...\" + (show) @mrssddr, sorry I am so late answering your question about some of the foods I can eat. Please remember I also am type 2 diabetic and have stage 4 CKD so I have had to compromise a lot since diets for those chronic diseases conflict with each other. At the height of my 1st gastroparesis flare-up I was in the hospital on clear liquids for 2 days then on the 3rd day a light meal of radioactive scrambled eggs and strawberry jam on toast for a gastric emptying study (I couldn't eat it all.) I also had an endoscopy and a colonoscopy the 4th day after being NPO the day before except for the bowel prep. After I was discharged I could eat nothing for several days but drank Boost, clear juices, popsicles, clean jelly (like apple jelly,) clear vegetable broth (I'm a vegetarian except for free-range eggs and a minimal amount of dairy cooked in certain breads, etc.) and other liquids. I was already nutritionally challenged and not being able to eat had a very negative impact on my stamina/energy as well as cognition and mood. A week later I was able to add a very few soft foods such as soft-scrambled or soft-boiled egg, reduced fat peanut butter, vegan ice cream, soft breads, small amounts of mashed potatoes, vegan yogurt, etc., along with Boost and the other foods mentioned above. It took nearly a year of very slowly re-introducing GI-friendly foods and some backing off from those that didn't agree with me but today I am able to eat much better. I generally have 1/2 serving of Boost for breakfast and 1/2 serving of yogurt or 1/2 Boost and 1 tbsp peanut butter plus 1/2 banana. Mid-morning meal is 1/2 serving of reduced sodium V8 and 1/3 to 1/2 pkg Lance peanut butter crackers. Lunch is peanut butter and jelly on a soft slider bun or 50 grams of ripe avocado and 1/2 tbsp lite mayo on a soft slider bun or sometimes egg salad (boiled egg mashed, pinch onion powder, 1 tbsp lite mayo) on soft slider bun. Afternoon meal is 1/2 serving mango juice (no pulp) and 1/3 to 1/2 pkg PB crackers. Dinner is another 1/2 Boost, 1/2 serving mashed potatoes or 61 grams baked potato without skin, 1/2 serving well-cooked carrots or well-cooked pureed beets. (Next week I will add a very small amount of potato salad I make with 61 grams of cubed baked potato and lite mayo plus a pinch of onion powder and 1 low-sodium no sugar added pickle slice-skin removed-chopped up to see if I can tolerate it; also will try a half-serving of cooked-to-mush spinach-since I need iron and B12-to see if I can tolerate that.) HS diabetic snack is 1/3 to 1/2 pkg PB crackers and a popsicle, sometimes extra if blood sugar is too low before taking bedtime insulin. Please know, I am not recommending any of the above for anyone else, it's just what has worked for me so far. Can anyone tell me if minute amounts of celery seed occasionally are ok on a gastroparesis diet? I know the recommendation is to avoid seeds but I'm talking about a very small pinch of something extremely tiny. Hi, I\u2019m brand new here\u2014 looking to connect/ find support with others dealing with GASTROPARESIS. I\u2019ve just been diagnosed. I also have Rheumatoid Arthritis, & Panic / Anxiety Disorder. I\u2019ve been researching and feel overwhelmed with all the information and potential severity of this unforeseen condition. If you have insights you are willing to share, I would be grateful!

But I was still hurting most days. Then I found a surgeon who did a procedure on me called a Pyloroplasty. I have a different life now. I still watch what I eat but rarely have pain. In reply to @lisawn215 \"Hi, I\u2019m brand new here\u2014 looking to connect/ find support with others dealing with GASTROPARESIS. I\u2019ve...\" + (show) @lisawn215, I too have other chronic conditions along with gastroparesis \u2013 renal disease and diabetes and depression and anxiety. Managing the conflicting diets for kidney disease and for diabetes and for gastro is quite the challenge. For instance, well-cooked spinach is ok on a gastro diet but it tends to form oxalates which may contribute to kidney stones and renal patients may not tolerate the potassium punch that spinach carries. This kind of yes/no about certain foods makes it difficult to get appropriate nutrition. Has anyone else heard or read that you should not re-heat cooked spinach because re-heating produces nitrites which are carcinogenic? In reply to @gsheets \"I was diagnosed in Dec and I also have anxiety. Each one makes the othet worse.\" + (show) It sure does! I am really struggling with the mental health piece\u2026so much to wrap my head around. In reply to @brendaharvey \"I suffered with Gastroparesis for over 3 years. The diet helped a little.

Can you tell me in what way your symptoms have improved status post the pyloroplasty. i.e. where you throwing up prior and are not now, did you have pain prior and none now \u2013 were you limited as to WHEN/how much you could eat and are not now etc. i am considering it. My main symptoms are gas/distension/pain/slight nausea/and i don't eat ANYTHING solid after 2 pm otherwise i cannot lay down to sleep. As it is that is the worst part of it \u2013 laying down with \"food from the day\" in my stomach \u2013 gas pain wakes me up throughout the night.. Thanks Denise In reply to @kamama94 \"@lisawn215, I too have other chronic conditions along with gastroparesis - renal disease and diabetes and...\" + (show) I've found GP nutrition information to be sorely lacking. I've just about given up eating solid food, since I have gut pain for days after solid food. GP is just another nail in the coffin for me. I can't find good help and it all feels kind of useless. A doctor that listens \u2013 actually listens- is like a fairy tale. I always have to double check every frug to make sure they aren't a out to kill me or, worse, make my symptoms more severe. In reply to @kamama94 \"Has anyone else heard or read that you should not re-heat cooked spinach because re-heating produces...\" + (show) I've never heard that, but food you can eat is worth cancer, for me anyway. The GP diagnosis has destroyed my old love of cooking healthy food. I dont even want to eat anymore. Not worth it. I worry about malnutrition, bit since both the dietician and the nutritionist I saw didn't help much. It's too overwhelming, every list of what to or not to eat is different\u2026 I'm shocked people don't just wither away from this disease. I'm afraid that I am slowly dying from GP and the associated malnutrition. I have congestive heart failure, so GP pretty much feels like a death sentance \"enhancer.\" I have trouble caring. I want to care, but I don't have the strength to fly solo anymore. In reply to @cherip \"I've found GP nutrition information to be sorely lacking. I've just about given up eating solid...\" + (show) @cherip, I can relate! Don't give up hope yet, though, like I did for a while. Mayo's support groups have been tremendously helpful. Sometimes there can be a delay in getting answers to questions but I have found people in these threads to be very supportive and helpful, quite willing to share ideas and strategies. This forum has listed several GP nutrition resources, including Mayo itself and Crystal Saltrelli, which I have found to be helpful in addition to what fellow GPers have shared. Also, I've been fortunate enough to already have a brilliant PCP who probably knows as much about my diabetes as would an endocrinologist and is expert in pharmacology (many docs aren't) as well as well-versed in nutrition. An added bonus is my nephrologist who not only helps me manage renal disease but also knows about nutrition. I finally am managing some soft solids after over a year of yukkiness both before and after meals (liquid or not) and lousy nutritional status as a result, causing extreme fatigue and low stamina and continued weakness. It has taken me awhile to finally accept that I cannot tolerate anything beyond liquid & soft, at least for now, and for the past three or four months I've been doing much better despite there still being yukky days. I now realize that there are going to be days when I must rest my GI system no matter how tired that makes me and unless the GP \"flare\" diet goes on too long there is less nutritional and physiological risk to that as there is to throwing up all the time and other not-fun symptoms. I hope you can find a doc or PA or NP who can help you even it GP isn't that person's specialty. And you are always welcome here! Sending you positive vibes! In reply to @denisef \"Brenda: i had communicated with you via this site a few weeks ago - soon after...\" + (show)  The Pyloroplasty has relieved my constant cramping. I suffered for over 3 years. Has relieved my constipation also. I am eating more foods now. I can eat before going to bed. I have not had meats or raw veggies or fruits. I will see a new Gastroenterologist on Feb 13 who was recommended by my surgeon to lead me along the path to adding foods. I was on liquids for weeks following the surgical procedure. The relief from my constant pain has just given me a new life!! In reply to @cherip \"I've found GP nutrition information to be sorely lacking. I've just about given up eating solid...\" + (show) I very much recommend you find a surgeon to do the Pyloroplasty procedure. I had cramped for 3-1/2 years and anything I ate made me cramp. I was on liquids for quite a while following the procedure but the surgeon told me it would take a full 3 months to see all the benefits of the procedure. I am so glad I had it. It is an entire new life. I am seeing a Gastroenterologist on Feb 13 recommended by my surgeon who will lead me into eating more foods. I haven\u2019t eaten meats or raw veggies or fruit yet except for banana. I am no longer sugar free, dairy free or gluten free. I have been able to get up and do my housework and to go to church. I am so thankful that I had this procedure done!! In reply to @denisef \"Brenda: i had communicated with you via this site a few weeks ago - soon after...\" + (show)  After my Pyloroplasty I was really sore for the 1st two weeks. The surgeon put me on liquids for 3 weeks. I get better every day. Prior to the surgery I was in bed for days at a time cramping so badly and had severe constipation. Now I am eating soft foods but the main thing is I am no longer in pain!!!! The surgeon said I would continue to improve over 3 month period. I feel so much better. I have no problem eating before I go to bed. He has referred me to a Gastroenterologist to guide me into eating more foods. In reply to @brendaharvey \"The Pyloroplasty has relieved my constant cramping. I suffered for over 3 years. Has relieved my...\" + (show)  THANK YOU for the update Brenda. I might consider having Botox injected first when I have my next EGD which would \"simulate/have similar effect \" to the pyloroplasty- and if things improve with that then I would move forward with the pyloroplasty which is obviously a more permanent \"fix\". My daughter is suffereing from GP, probably brought on by Covid according to the surgeon. She had botox and it seemed to help, so they did the G-POEM but it is not better, seems worse! Anyone have success with Motegrity, or the gut motility supplements \u2013 with Ginger and Artichoke? We are also trying Accupuncutre, hasn't helped yet. Any other ideas? I am trying to talk GI doc into trying Motegrity, but they seem as slow as her gut to do much of anything. Frustrated Mom !! 7 years ago I had a Nissen Surgery to reduce GERD.. something went terribly wrong.. the local surgeon and GI person couldn't figure it out for nearly 2 months as I lost 50 pounds.. I went to Mayo Minnesota..they figured it out in a day with 3 tests.. \"post operative gastropanesis\".. nerves that surround the stomach were injured.. they do not regenerate.. surgery cannot be undone\u2026 so every meal is a challenge.. Go get other competent help.. In reply to @playball \"My daughter is suffereing from GP, probably brought on by Covid according to the surgeon. She...\" + (show)  I tried Motegrity and it made me worse! On Nov 1 I had a Pyloroplasty by a surgeon in Louisville, Ky. I feel like a different person! Such pain relief.

I find that they are the best at diagnosing complex medical conditions. They are several posts about what people who have gastroparesis find to eat srarch for gastroparesis). I hope you can find things that you can eat that give you a little joy. I am not a healthcare provider but have had GI issues for more than a decade. Wishing you good health. Annabelle"

          "I have had problems similar to so many GI people. The swallowing problems (food stuck in the throat, bloating, nausea, feeling like choking, \u201cfullness\u201d for hours). Finally after many upper and lower scopes ( have 18 cm colon left and function 80% well when cervical neck is well), a small hiatal hernia, numerous different PPI\u2019s for stomach changes, reflux, etc. and now on Nexium, the finding out the main problem 6 years ago was gastroparesis caused by a pain medication. Instead of a pacemaker, I tried a \u201cnewly\u201d approved drug for the pyloric muscle of the lower stomach, botox, placed in 3 places to keep the muscle open a little so food could continually be released into the small intestine. The erythromycin in a low dose is a prokinetic, making the nerves contract the stomach muscles but, wasn\u2019t working. Still use 4x/day. This way no food collected in the stomach being able to \u201crot\u201d causing sepsis, and decreased daily nausea and vomiting. I still can only eat small amounts and is more liquid or soft medicine/foods. My appetite isn\u2019t the best. I often have reflux, bloating, constipation and hoarseness. But it has been 3 yrs since botox to my stomach and it is working. I take my blessing where I can. I hope this helpe others.\nAlso, my diet had to change to rapidly digesting foods like white bread and not the \u201cgood\u201d eating I was doing like whole wheat or 21 grain bread ( was laying on my stomach for hours), plus many vegetables and also many raw vegetables\u2026a no no.\nMy daughter is going through so much of this and is an RN. Has Barrett\u2019s esophagitis, hiatal hernia, dysplasia, leaky gut syndrome i.e. and awaiting biopsies. Constant n/v, bloating,hoarseness, food in the throat like you in the chat.She is also an RN. On many \u201cnew\u201d meds again.\nIt really can get to you especially when you work and have a very busy life like she does.\nMy best to all. Hope I could help someone.I understand your frustrations. It is wonderful having an understanding doctor that listens!"
