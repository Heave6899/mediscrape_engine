[{"Query":"I went to the hospital with a headache after drinking 6 beers. They found high liver enzymes (AST at 332, ALT at 141). I stopped drinking, ate healthier, and after 2 months the levels returned to normal and have stayed normal for 2 more months. Could alcohol have caused the high levels, and am I okay now?

          " Yes, the organ, liver is very forgiving. It regenerates itself, and will give you many chances depending on your age, unless you abuse it over the limit. <p>Now Then luis05506 &quot; just drink plenty of water and dilute the (ALE) In your bloodstream&#39; an don&#39;t eat Banana&quot;s there really BAD for the Liver you know Bro&#39; &#128531; </p> Hi \u200bIm sorry t say that being an alcoholic doesnt necessarily mean that you drink 24/7 it could mean any unt of times as alcohol affects different people for different reasons, i would suggest that you go to your G.P and ask for blood tests to check your Liver function and depending what they come back as i would ask to be refered to a liver specialist who are of course more qualified to be able to read the results and give you a more diffinitive answer. I have Liver failiure and have just been to my first assesment for transplant and whether im suitable, right from the start of my problems my local liver team have concluded that it is down to alcohol however on attending this 1st appointment for a possible transplant they have suggested that it may be non alcoholic fatty liver disease which is being checked with blood tests because although all along i have told them my mum had liver failiure they decided it was purley down to alcohol. \u200bSome may say what you drink is minimul but some would say you are drinking far to much its a case of your body bein tested correctly to determine if you have a problem, but be assured that either way they will tell you that you are drinking to much, i have not touched a drop of alcohol since about sept/oct 2015 and i need a transplant so cut it down or even out totally if you can because if there is a problem and it isnt to bad then your Liver may heal itself over time. Hope it goes well and im sorry i couldnt be of anymore help to you but good luck  <p>Hi Luis, I don&#39;t think you have anything to worry about. If you are worried go and see your GP. You are young, your liver will repair quicker than someone older. What I would say is watch your alcohol consumption. Some people can drink all their life and never get liver disease, others who drink a lot less may incur liver problems, we are all different. I never knew too many bananas are not good for the liver. I eat 2 a day, I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s too much! Wishing you the best Luis.&#160;</p>"

Every day 500 patients die waiting for a liver transplant. So sick some have to have their bellies drained from 3-7 liters of fluid a week. This is generally due to, too much ammonia in the body since the liver has shut down and toxins are in the body. There are 100&#39;s of diseases caused by alcohol abuse.</p><p></p><p>Your liver can have a difficult time processing alcohol, especially if you drink a lot regularly \u2013 the liver processes alcohol like a toxin because it can have toxic effects on your liver. Excessive drinking and alcohol abuse can severely damage your liver beyond repair. Alcohol Abuse and as little as three drinks at one time combined with medication like acetaminophen can be toxic to the liver. The bottom line is, alcohol can have severe negative effects on the liver and cutting it out of your diet can help lower liver enzymes. The choice is yours see the many guide line on the alcohol forum on how to cut down on toxic alcohol and give your liver a break.</p><p></p><p>You only have one liver! Just as you only have one heart ?? &#128077;Take care of it! You have other people in your life who love and need you. This is so frustrating and many ask this question knowing the truth .&#160;</p><p></p><p>Can you find a way to cut down your daily intake ??? Your liver will love ?

I would cut the drinking. At least till your liver enzymes return to normal. Could take weeks. I had blood work in December and my alp was 141 and alt 52. So I went without drinking for 3 months and alt went down to 22. But my alp a mere 131. I&#39;m obese so that can be factor for high alp but I&#39;m losing weight. Doctor says not to worry too much.

          " Oh, and I also rarely drink except like once a month or less.  mine were both between mid 300's and low 400's. I'm waiting for result of my blood tests and ultra sound. It is very scary I agree. My levels always been normal. I get blood test from my Endo Dr. every 6 month so this caught me off guard. I will post results of test as soon as I recieve them. I wouldnt worry too much, but I do know you need to drink alot of water each day to flush your body. I have a similar issue. I'm very healthy 37 yo and my ALT/AST since Sept 2018 range between AST: 265 - 531 and ALT: 131-257. I had $6K worth of bloodwork done and they found NOTHING. B12 > 5000 and Ferritin >350 otherwise nothing. Stable benign liver tumor since 2015 they consider a non-factor. I didn't drink much before and now they tell me zero alcohol since September. I retest every 14 days and I can't imagine this continuing for years but mine have not gone back to normal since the first test. They were normal in Feb 2018 but the next time I tested was Sept 2018 and since then highly elevated. I exercise 3-4 days a week, I eat keto/paleo and drink about a gallon of water ever day. UPDATE: so I went to another specialist and they had a MRI done. He said I have gallstones so that most likely was the reason for these high enzymes. I'm extremely received. I will be having it removed within the next few months so hopefully they won't ever elevate or cause me pain again! I'm going through the same thing. My liver enzymes has always been normal. 16 months ago had cat scan everything normal but gallbladder. Had my gallbladder out and ever since my liver enzymes have been up. Going back for more test soon, but everything was good until I had my gallbladder removed.  Hello, I've got high readings as well, everything else seems to be fine. I've been referred to a Gastroenterologist. i've been constipated for years as well and have been stressed lately. Has anyone else got an update? See if your doctor will do a blood test for Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency or refer you to a gastroenterologist for a liver study. I had intermittent elevated LFTs and it turns out I have a genetic condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver if unchecked. There are other Liver conditions that can be uncovered by a Liver study. Did they say why your vitamin b12 is so high? "

I took an entire week of work for Thanksgiving and I had 3 major anxiety attacks this week. I used to have small palpitation spikes that have occured once a week for the past few months. I had two major panic attacks, one in April and one in August, for which I went to the ER for both. Both they did EKG&#39;s and blood work and said they couldn&#39;t find anything other than my TSH was slightly high at 12.</p><p></p><p>Long story short after the panic attacks this week I went to the doctor (skipped the insane ER bills) and they ran a few tests on me. They also gave me Xanax which take as needed. I&#39;ve only taken it once out of the three days I&#39;ve had it and worked wonders. Never had the burning/tingling just nice calm release. </p><p></p><p>As for the blood panel everything was fine except for the liver enzymes. My ALT was 148~ and my AST was 78~. I haven&#39;t had a second test yet but I go into the doctor tomorrow for an ultrasound.</p><p></p><p>Did you ever get a diagnosis/updates on your situation?</p> Good afternoon! Will you please update the board with your story? I have the same symptoms and almost the exact same ALT/AST numbers. I would love to hear how you made out.Thank you. Any updates from anyone? I have literally the EXACT same story. Very similar enzyme levels. Even the recurring styes! Extremely interested to know your outcomes. 3rd set of bloods booked for next week and Liver Ultrasound planned after that. <p>I also just joined the site to track progress with what is going on with you. I&#39;ve been consistently seeing a doctor for 4 years for malice, fatigue, anxiety, brain fog, poor memory and focus, etc. My ALT and AST were elevated slightly 3 times in a row, as well as Bilirubin. Doc said it could be a genetic thing with the Bilirubin. As a person with Anxiety I can&#39;t stand words like: &quot;possibly, could, maybe, perhaps &amp; I wouldn&#39;t worry about it.&quot; After feeling completely hopeless from this doctor because my symptoms were worsening as well as finding new things to add to the list of weird s**t going on, I decided to break up with my doctor and see someone else. The new doctor also discovers elevated liver enzymes and Bilirubin. She then tells me that I *could* have a genetic thing that just makes me bilirubin naturally higher. I said that I have heard that before and that I was feeling a bit frustrated with the &#39;could&#39; nonsense so she ordered an ultrasound to look into it. The ultrasound showed multiple calcified granulomas in my spleen indicating I had once had some bad virus or infection from what I gather? It also showed possible fatty liver or liver disease, but the results were unclear so she directed me to a Gasteroenterologist who ordered $4k worth of tests including different type of hepatic labs, as well as an Elastography MRI to show the grade that my liver is in more accurately. Luckily I have insurance... So I finished my tests this week and will hear back by Tuesday. I&#39;m nervous. My usually high anxiety has been through the roof. I keep noticing I have all the symptoms of well - everything... but mostly Hepatitis C. I&#39;ve never used IV drugs, but I do have a lot of tattoos and used to have a lot of piercings. Jee... my mind is going all over the place. Point is, I am glad your doc is taking your situation seriously. I urge anyone who feels anxious about their health or has a feeling as something really not being right to be seen. Second opinions, too! I did my fair share of drinking from 16-23 when my husband and I decided to start a family. Since then I can hardly drink. I may every 2 months on a date. A few drinks leaves me with a TERRIBLE hangover lasting 2-3 days sometimes. Just assumed it was my body getting older and tolerating less from having kids, but now I wonder. I&#39;m 28... wish my luck as I sincerely wish you luck and hope to receive an update. I wouldn&#39;t mind making a friend or two just to talk with sometimes. &#128521;</p>"

          " Hi Michael, I am not an expert or Dr on liver tests but having had about a hundred of them in the past year I have come to learn a things or too. ALT is a marker for liver cell damage. So at a level just higher than normal I wouldn't be overly concerned. If any other markers go up with it then I would be concerned. Have you have any scans? I would say you need an ultrasound at least. My high markers were put down to a fatty liver. Which I have managed to clear. However my ALP level is up and down like you wouldn't believe. Very annoying and worrying for me but I've had to learn that's it probably just the way my body is. It's never higher than 3 marks above normal and always comes down again. I have read that it is best to fast for at least 8 hours prior to a liver test as something as simple as I fatty meal can cause readings to be abnormal. I found this to be true as I ate a McDonald's and had a milkshake before one of my tests and my levels jumped up slightly. However on my next test a week later (after fasting) they were normal again. Do you have any other symptoms? Right sided pain? Loose stools? Fatigue? Gem  Hi Michael, mine was 53 and is up and down. I asked my GP about the level and he said they would only start to worry if it was above 100. I am on some heavy duty drugs, which is why my blood results are up and down. Even taking extra paracetamol can cause your alt to rise. Don't worry. The main liver enzymes are AST and ALT, normal AST levels are between 10 and 40 while normal ALT levels are between 7 and 56. I doubt you have anything too serious, but if your GP suspects that you possibly have anything seriously wrong with your Liver then he will refer you to a Hepatologist. Don't sweat it, those tests aren't very accurate. For example, all my tests always come back normal except for when i have an ERCP or MRI and then they see all my liver damage and all the crap in there. But if you are concerned, you can get an ultrasound to know for sure. Plus if you take any medicines at all it could mess with it, or even if you exersize a lot. In general, these test are easy to get messed up and be inacurate. <p>Hi, </p><p></p><p>I&#39;ve just had results of 45 for my liver enzymes, that&#39;s all the doctor said and didn&#39;t say exactly what that was in reference to. Apparently this is slightly raised.</p><p></p><p>I&#39;ve never felt pain on or around my liver but I have since he pressed on my tummy to feel it (3 days ago) </p><p></p><p>I have been referred to have an ultrasound and further blood tests, I&#39;m 34 and really scared as I have a history of drinking quite a bit but have stopped smoking and drinking a few months ago. I never drank daisy or anything, just had issues stopping when I started, so have stopped cololeltey for the last 9 weeks. In no way related to a liver issue I was aware of.</p><p></p><p>I just wanted to know does this number reflect the type of damage done? Or is it not a reflecting at all, ie slight raise slight could mean only slight damage. I&#39;m actually having panic attacks and feeling really scared about all of this. </p><p></p><p></p> <p>My ALT was just 7 and I&#39;m worked it is too low!&#160;</p>"

          " Hi @bumble81, There have been formal studies done for patients who have had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy that showed elevated liver enzymes post-op. due to the CO2 pneumoperitoneum (the CO2 air bubble in the abdominal cavity), but it says that the majority of the patients returned to normal levels within a few weeks. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3134700/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15776093 https://www.currentsurgery.org/index.php/jcs/article/view/334/314 @rosemarya @hopeful33250 @bonitav and @jimhd have all mentioned having gallbladder surgery, wondering if they have ever heard of this. Bumble, was your surgery laparoscopic? Have you had your enzymes tested recently and are they still elevated? Hello @bumble81 I can understand your concern over the elevated liver enzymes. We all want to have a healthy liver and if we think there is a problem it can certainly cause anxiety. I had my gallbladder removed a number of years ago, however, it was in connection with another surgery to remove carcinoid cancer from a nearby area in the digestive tract. Because it was part of a larger surgery I was never sure what problems were associated with the gallbladder removal and what was attributed to the more extensive cancer surgery. Here is a Connect discussion from Members who have had gall bladder surgery, https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/gallbladder-surgery/ There is another disorder that can follow gallbladder removal. It is rather rare and doctors may not think of it. It is called Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. According to this information on the NIH website, elevated liver enzymes are typical with SOD. Here is the link with more information, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3096116/. With that in mind, I wonder, as did Amanda (@amandaburnett), which type of gallbladder surgery you had and when you last had the liver enzymes tested. Please share as you are comfortable doing so, @bumble81, but I'm wondering, besides the elevated liver enzymes, have you had any other symptoms since your surgery? Do you have any other family members with liver and/or gallbladder problems? I had my gallbladder laparoscopically 6 days ago. On Friday night, I began to have this uncontrollable itch all over. I went to the ER the next morning and it was discovered my liver enzymes were significantly elevated (see attached picture). They even reached out to my surgeon who ordered an ultrasound because he did not like my numbers. Preliminary results showed nothing was wrong. They gave me two prescriptions to help with the itching until I follow up with the surgeon on Monday. Based upon my liver enzyme numbers, how concerned should I be? In reply to @tamekabonner \"I had my gallbladder laparoscopically 6 days ago. On Friday night, I began to have this...\" + (show) Hi @tamekabonner and welcome! You will see I moved your post to a discussion that is talking about the same thing. Mayo Clinic Connect is a platform where patients can connect with other patients to share and compare health issues. What type of Rxs did they give you and did your surgeon say why the ultrasound was ordered? @amandaburnett Thank you! I was given Hydroxyzine & Famotidine. My surgeon ordered an ultrasound, because he wanted to ensure there wasn't a blockage in the bile ducts. The results were released this morning it stated that the common bile duct was not definitively imaged. I also have had elevated liver enzymes prior to and after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In fact one of the reasons my Dr. gave for having a cholecystectomy was elevated liver enzymes. However, it did not cause them to go down but have stayed elevated and even worsened over time. I'm curious about what else could cause this besides alcohol. In reply to @jasonharjo \"I also have had elevated liver enzymes prior to and after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In fact one...\" + (show) @jasonharjo Good morning, I hope you are doing well after your surgery. My name is Sandi and I am a patient Ambassador with the American Liver Foundation. I am being treated by Northwestern in Chicago since I was diagnosed with cirrhosis in May of 2020. If you have not already, I would suggest seeing a hepatologist for the elevated liver enzymes. If you are located near a medical center, you can find one there. These providers are trained to manage the specifics of the liver and can give you the best direction and also follow your case and trend lines. I wish you all the best and if you would like to discuss more, please let me know. In reply to @tamekabonner \"I had my gallbladder laparoscopically 6 days ago. On Friday night, I began to have this...\" + (show) Why was your gallbladder removed? Did it burst by chance. 20 yrs ago, my brothers Gallbladder burst. He was quite sick and in the hospital for 6 weeks. After recovery, his liver enzymes were high for all those years. The doctors all thought he was drinking when he wasn't. Consequently, it turned out that when his gallbladder burst, 93 gallstones lodged into his liver which is very rare. Fortunately he found a doctor who read about this and did exploratory surgery. He had to remove 60% of my brothers liver. After 6 weeks the liver regenerated itself and my brother was fine. I'm not saying this is your case, but suggesting you run it by your doctor for a possibility. Hope you feel better soon. I had my Gallbladder removed on October 16th laparoscopically. My liver enzymes have been extremely elevated since. I have alway had my blood work done every 3 months and they have alway been normal. My most recent ALT was 387 and my AST was 109. I have an appt with a gastro/liver doctor on Monday. Is this normal for my levels to be so high because of me having no GB now. In reply to @aprilgrivet \"I had my Gallbladder removed on October 16th laparoscopically. My liver enzymes have been extremely elevated...\" + (show) Hi @aprilgrivet, did you learn anything at your gastro-liver appointment yesterday that you could share with the group? I got my gallbladder removed in 2014 prior to surgery my liver enzymes were completely normal i was healthy aside my gallbladder being \u201cchronically inflamed\u201d according to my Surgeon. I got a repeat of my blood work 6 weeks after my surgery due to still having slight discomfort/ pain on the right side of my abdomen. My liver enzymes were \u201cslightly elevated\u201d my surgeon did tests to make sure no gallstones were left behind, I got multiple endoscopy done with no answer to my elevated enzymes. Fast forward to now it has been 8 years since surgery and I still have elevated enzyme levels 150 points over the normal limit with still no explanation as to why and what the cause is. I was told possible sphincter of oddi dysfunction by one dr got a second opinion and the other dr didn\u2019t think so. I was told possibly a autoimmune disorder but haven\u2019t been diagnosed with one. My liver enzymes never returned to normal after surgery. I\u2019m not a drinker, smoker or use really any medications. My Next step is a liver biopsy which I\u2019m nervous about, but hopefully whatever issue is going it\u2019s not too late and my Liver isn\u2019t severely damaged all because I needed my gallbladder removed. I\u2019m worried, scared that I don\u2019t have much time left and I will be leaving my child behind due to whatever issue I have with my liver. It has now taken a toll on my mental health. In reply to @bubbles69 \"I got my gallbladder removed in 2014 prior to surgery my liver enzymes were completely normal...\" + (show)   Welcome @bubbles69. I moved your message to this existing discussion: \u2013 Elevated liver enzymes after gallbladder removal: https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/elevated-liver-enzymes-after-gallbladder-removal/ I did this so you could read previous posts and connect easily with members who have had similar experiences like @bumble81 @tamekabonner @jasonharjo @sandif @bfort @sueinmn @aprilgrivet and more. Bubbles, I can imagine you are scared and very worried. I had laparoscopic cholecystectomy 11/16/22. Elevated liver enzymes prior to surgery were sudden nearly 500 both AST and ALT. I have a bike duct stent that was inserted day before surgery ERCP procedure. I gave a JP drain that fills up daily , I am getting 300cc see surgeon tomorrow first follow up. But my AFP tumor maker was 39.8 and they think I have cancer in my abdomen somewhere. Any thoughts?? Please In reply to @bubbles69 \"I got my gallbladder removed in 2014 prior to surgery my liver enzymes were completely normal...\" + (show)   I am In exactly the same situation. I don\u2019t know what happens next. Gastro is not interested in my care. I may need a liver biopsy as well. My surgery was almost 4 weeks ago Hi there, I'm 33, gay, caucasian male. I have been on a bit of a battle with my liver enzymes for the past year and a half. I am going to try to summarise all of this quickly in bullet form: \u2013 End of 2021, my psychiatrist picked up elevated ALT \u2013 April 2022, I went for SADI surgery (gastric surgery) to reduce my weight (I was 150kgs) \u2013 May 2022, I went for preliminary bloods and it showed my ALT was in the normal range (29 U/l) \u2013 June 2022, I had to have my gallbladder removed, it was done laparoscopically \u2013 July 2022, I had bloods done again, and it was slightly elevated but not extremely (38 U/l) \u2013 3 days ago, I had my bloods tested again and my physician simply said to me \"your gamma\" is really high (I didn't know that this was liver function \u2013 I am used to the term ALT, so I didn't think to ask her what this could be considering my history of ALT, nor did I think to ask her what the actual number is). She said to me that it may be because of my depression and anxiety medication (I am on sertraline 300mg, lamotrigine 150mg, Voxra 150mg and Seroquel 200mg). I couldn't face her (and I am ashamed now) to tell her that I went off my medication around June 2022. I know, I know\u2026 its bad that I did that, and I am seeing my psychiatrist on the 29th Jan and I will talk to him then too about this. My point of admitting this, is that because I have been off of the meds for so long, I think its unlikely that 'the meds' are the reason for the elevation. Considering my history above, I am now petrified that its liver cancer. I absolutely hate alcohol (never drink) and I do not smoke either (so I am obviously ruling those out as causes of the liver damage\u2026 so cancer jumps to mind again). I am a gay male, and I do (heavily) use a stimulant called poppers (I know, I know\u2026 this is bad for you. I am going to stop now). Do you think it could be this maybe? I know that no one here can diagnose me (especially since all I know about the ALT/'gamma' is that it is 'very high' \u2013 i.e. no number) and that I need to consult my doctors, and I am in the process of doing this now, but I am quite panicked at the moment. Is there anything anyone can say to reassure me. Please :(. I have terrible health anxiety (hence my psychiatric medication\u2026). Not sure if this is significant, but I do experience like a slight pain (feels like heaviness) in my right shoulder, especially at night \u2013 but this could be posture related as I do work in front of the computer. Hi In the beginning of September 2022 my ALT Was 116. In October it went down to 103. After that it very gradually decreased to 29, which is barely above the minimum standard. Another liver enzyme, AST, was 52 during my September 2022 blood tests (it should have been between 13 & 39). It too has come down well below the max. to normal 29 in the past 5 months. I still have 2 Liver enzymes coming down to the normal range but not yet there. One is GGT which came down from 660 to 290 (normal max=64!). Another enzyme, ALP, has come down from 255 to 218 (max. normal is 121). These enzymes fluctuate so much even doctors sometimes have no explanation. I did two liver biopsies & an MRI. Despite the above significant disparities from the standard, all results came back normal. My hepatologist (i.e liver doctor) did some adjustments on the dosage of the medications I was on & added a new one. I believe these adjustments helped very much. Please do not worry that much. Liver cancer has its own awful & nasty symptoms & from your post nothing indicates that way. For full disclosure, I am not a doctor nor am I related to medicine in any way. Liver enzymes fluctuate for so many reasons & most are just transient & benign. Just faithfully adhere to whatever your doctor instructs you to do. Do not take the liberty of dropping prescribed medication arbitrarily into your own hands. Because it is not yours. After all that \u2013 just leave all your anxiety & worries at our Lord's feet (or whoever you believe in) & walk away. You will be surprised God will find a way out for you. If you trust He will not fail you. I am a liver transplant recipient. In reply to @rgb3547 \"Hi In the beginning of September 2022 my ALT Was 116. In October it went down...\" + (show)     This is a beautiful post full of hope for any reader. Thank you!"
